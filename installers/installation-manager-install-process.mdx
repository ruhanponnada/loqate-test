The following sections demonstrate the steps of the installation process for Install Manager installation. The installer to be used depends on the platform and the flavor of the API already installed. On Windows and Linux, if the API installed is of 64-bit flavor, we need to use the 64-bit Install Manager Installer from the corresponding platform. Click here to view the installer options.

Installation using GUI

For Install Manager to work, the Loqate Java API is required. If not found in the installation directory, the following error will be shown.

After the welcome screen the next screen requires selection of the installation folder. This folder needs to be the folder where the Loqate API is currently installed. The next screen is the review screen.

The next screen will install the Install Manager and complete the installation.

Installation of the Install Manager will install the InstallManager.jar file, a lib folder containing the dependent libraries and a local copy of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) as well. The JRE is needed to run the Install Manager. This local copy of JRE will not affect any system settings on the target machine.

Installation using the Command Line Interface
On Linux/Unix platforms, the preferred method of installation is using the command line interface.

Installation of the Install Manager will install the InstallManager.jar file, a lib folder containing the dependent libraries and a local copy of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) as well. The JRE is needed to run the Install Manager. This local copy of JRE will not affect any system settings on the target machine.
