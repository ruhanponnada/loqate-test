title: "Offline Installation"
---

This section will describe offline installation scenario where the user is not able to connect to the internet and has a license pack file, and proceeds to download and install the data packs.

In order to proceed with offline installation, the license pack and the data packs need be downloaded separately in a machine which has internet connectivity and then copied over to the install machine so that the Install Manager can access them at install time.

The recommended steps for installation are as follows:

- Download License pack on a machine with internet access using the License Key
- Download datapacks(\*.lfz files) on a machine with internet access
- Copy the downloaded license pack and downloaded datapacks to the machine where they have to be installed (with no internet access).
- Run the Install Manager on the install machine to install the datapacks.
  The following sections demonstrate the steps in the data installation process.

## Graphical User Interface Mode

Download

Install Manager should be run on a machine which can access the internet.

If a proxy server is used, the checkbox "Use Proxy Server" needs to be checked and the Proxy server name and port need to be entered as shown below. If the proxy server needs authentication, the checkbox "Use authentication for proxy server" should also be checked & the user name and password need to be provided.

The first step is to provide the installation folder. The Loqate License Pack will be written to this folder. Until 2015Q1 release, the Loqate license pack was named loqateLicense. From 2015Q1 release the license pack format is changed from "loqateLicense" to "license.lfs".

In the next step provide a license key. When a license key is entered, Install Manager will communicate with licensing.loqate.com. If the license key is valid, the server will return the corresponding license pack to Install Manager and then Install Manager will write the license pack to the installation folder.

Once the license pack is saved to disk, Install Manager will display the contents of the license for reference.

After a valid option is selected, Install Manager will communicate with licensing.loqate.com and fetch details about the latest available licensed data packs that are compatible with the Local API version that is currently installed. The details of available data packs to install will be shown next. In the case a user selects an existing data folder for installation, it will show newer data packs available to download and install. The release date of the available data packs will also be displayed. The user can select the required data packs from this screen by checking the checkboxes next to each product.
