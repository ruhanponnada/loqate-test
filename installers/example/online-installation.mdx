  The following sections demonstrate the steps in the data installation process.

## Graphical User Interface Mode

Install Manager can be started in GUI mode by providing the command line option: mode=gui. GUI mode is the default mode on Windows platforms. On Windows platforms, Install Manager can be launched by double clicking on InstallManager.bat.

If a proxy server is used, the checkbox "Use Proxy Server" needs to be checked and the Proxy server name and port need to be entered as shown below.

The next step is to provide a license key. When a license key is entered, Install Manager will communicate with licensing.loqate.com. If the license key is valid, the server will return the corresponding license pack to Install Manager and then Install Manager will write the license pack to the installation folder.

Once the license pack is saved to disk, Install Manager will display the contents of the license for reference.

After a valid option is selected, Install Manager will communicate with licensing.loqate.com and fetch details about the latest available licensed data packs that are compatible with the Local API version that is currently installed. The details of available data packs to install will be shown next. In the case a user selects an existing data folder for installation, it will show newer data packs available to download and install. The release date of the available data packs will also be displayed. The user can select the required data packs from this screen by checking the checkboxes next to each product.
