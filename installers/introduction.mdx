Loqate software installation involves installation of the API and the GKR (Global Knowledge Repository) data packs. In the next sections we will walk through the steps of the installation process for the Local API and then the installation of the GKR using the Installation Manager. We will discuss the steps for installation using Graphical User Interface mode for Windows as well as the command line interface for Linux/Unix platforms.

The recommended steps for installation are as follows:

- [Install the Local API](/installers/local-api-install-process/)
- Request a license key from Loqate Support at support@loqate.com
- [Install the data packs](/installers/data-installation-and-update-process/) as needed, using Install Manager
- [Example of installation scenarios](/installers/example/installation-scenarios/)
- [Learn how to obtain version information](/release-information/how-to-obtain-version-information/)
