[< Full country/territory list](/data-coverage/introduction/)

Each country may have multiple reference data files, which will serve different processes in the cleanse product.

- **vfy** = provides only the verification data for the country
- **geo** = serves the geocode data for the country (also provides verification data where vfy files are not available/used)
- **pnt** = will contain point-level/rooftop geocode data, typically used in addition to vfy and/or geo files, but may also provide the verification data
- **ggg** = means the country has completed the [Loqate country improvement process (PDH)](/getting-started/country-improvement-program/) and both geo and pnt are now combined and optimized.

**Please note that the Record Count and Geocode Count values can be misleading, as our datasets will typically use ranged, rolled up, or interpolated premise and building data.**
