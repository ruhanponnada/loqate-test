## Degrees of completeness

When we’re reporting on the coverage levels, we use the + and – symbols to report on how good we are at that level, and the saturation levels help calculate this. For example, an L4- country will have premise data, but since the premise saturation is low, it won’t be well covered. We added this feature to the scoring mechanism as we had some countries that only contained a handful of premise numbers, but we still advertised it as an L4 country.
