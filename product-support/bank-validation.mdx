### Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is Bank Validation available worldwide?">
    Most of the Bank Validation services are UK-only, however we do provide an
    International service which covers EMEA. You can find out more about the
    International service in [its API
    documentation](https://www.loqate.com/api/InternationalBankValidation/Interactive/Validate/1/).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why does the address listed for this branch not match its physical location?">
    Manybanks use a central processing depot for their BACS and
    othertransactions. Therefore a BACS check on a specific sort code may return
    the bank's central depot rather than the specific branch address.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will Bank Validation return information on the account holder?">
    No, we do not hold any information on individual accounts. When you make a
    Bank Validation request, you will only ever receive information back
    regarding the sort code, with confirmation of whether the account number
    matches that sort code.
