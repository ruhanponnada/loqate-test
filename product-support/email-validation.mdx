### Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion
  title="How does Email Validation work - are addresses checked against a database?"
  >
    Loqate's Email Validation service can validate emails either individually or in
    bulk, and follows a series of steps to confirm whether email addresses are valid
    or not. Those steps include:

    - Checking the syntax of the inputted address to ensure it's a plausible address
      (i.e. it contains an '@' sign and an email domain, etc.)
    - Verifying the validity of the email domain to make sure it can send and
      receive emails
    - 'Pinging' the mailbox to check whether it will accept emails to the specified
      account. We can validate whether an email address exists on an email server
      with 97% accuracy

      - We also have proprietary integrations with mailbox providers which allow us
        to verify things like whether a mailbox is a catch-all mailbox, whether the
        domain is disposable or temporary, etc.

    they're for business or personal accounts.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
  title="What types of information are returned in the Email Validation results?"
  >
    Besides detecting if in email address is valid or not, the Email Validation
    service returns a wide range of information, including - but not limited to -
    the following:

    - Whether an email address is disposable
    - If the domain is considered 'high risk' to send email to
    - If the mailbox is a role-based address (i.e. support@, marketing@, etc.)
    - If the mailbox is full

    You can find complete details of which fields are returned in our
    [Email Validation API documentation](https://www.loqate.com/api/email-validation/)
    (please note that the exact available fields may differ depending on which
    service you use).

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
  title="What does a 'catch all' response code mean?"
  >
    Each of the Email Validation endpoints includes a 'catch all' field as one of
    the response parameters:

    - [Batch Validate (v1.2)](https://www.loqate.com/api/email-validation/Batch/Validate/1.2/):
      the **Accept_All** Status
    - [Interactive Validate (v2)](https://www.loqate.com/api/email-validation/Interactive/Validate/2/):
      the **Valid_CatchAll** ResponseCode
    - [Bulk Email Validation](https://www.loqate.com/apis/email-validation/bulk-email-validation/):
      the **accept_all** Primary Status

    These 'catch all' responses indicate email domains that will accept emails to
    **any** email account, meaning that it is not possible to fully validate an
    email account at this domain, often due to firewall restrictions. We provide
    these 'catch all' responses so that you can decide whether or not you want to
    email these addresses.
