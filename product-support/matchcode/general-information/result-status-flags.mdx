title: "Explanation Of 'ResultStatus' Flags"
---

For the IdM Services, it is possible to have various returns for the 'ResultStatus' flags. Here is additional explanation of these result flags:

NONE, SINGLE and MULTIPLE reflect the number of matches returned from a query

**NA** means we can’t determine any other result status because of either incorrect user input or there was some error or otherwise from the service. (e.g. there’s a maximum of 10 emails you can verify, if the user enters > 10 then the response will indicate that more than 10 were attempted but the resultStatus will be NA because ultimately no verifications were actually carried out).

(This is different from **NONE** which means a definite lookup was performed and no records were found.)

**PICKLIST** means the results offer a pick list to choose from in order to further refine a search – (currently only used in telephone service if a user has to choose from a list of possible localities because the original locality searched was too vague)

**VERIFY** is used in our validation products (e.g. telephone or email validation) it shows the response is a result of a validation rather than e.g. an address lookup.
