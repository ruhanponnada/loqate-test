## Formatting Options

Formatting options follow a field name in brackets:

fieldname(option[=value[;value]...][,option]...)

### General options

Applies to the address element fields ORGANISATION through COUNTY.

| Option     | Abbrev | Values | Description    |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | -------------- |
| CHANGECASE | CA     | 0/1/2  | Character case |

### CHANGECASE values

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 0     | lower case  |
| 1     | UPPER CASE  |
| 2     | Title Case  |

e.g.

STREET(CA=2)

This sequence returns the street name in upper and lower case (i.e. title case)

### County options (UK datasets)

These options apply to the address element field COUNTY, and to the county as used in the formatted address ADDR.

| Option          | Abbrev | Values | Description                                                                                |
| --------------- | ------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| FULLCOUNTYNAME  | FC     | n/a    | Full postal county name (default is the Royal Mail standard abbreviation where one exists) |
| ADMINCOUNTYNAME | AC     | n/a    | Administrative county name                                                                 |
| TRADCOUNTYNAME  | TC     | n/a    | Traditional county name                                                                    |

Note: these three options are mutually exclusive

e.g.

COUNTY(FC)

This sequence returns the postal county name in it's unabbreviated form.

### Postcode options (UK datasets only)

These options apply to the postcode field POSTCODE.
| Option | Abbrev | Values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POSTCODEFORMAT | PF | 1-12 | Specify the length of the postcode and incode justification (how many spaces there are between incode and outcode) |
| POSTCODEPART | PP | 1 to 127 | A bitmap specifying permitted partial postcodes |

### POSTCODEFORMAT values

| Value | Description                                                                    |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | max 7 characters, incode left justified (Max 1 space) e.g. AB210AA, B1.0AA     |
| 2     | all 7 characters, incode right justified (0/1/2 spaces) e.g. AB210AA, B1..0AA  |
| 3     | max 8 characters, incode left justified (Always 1 space) e.g. AB21.0AA, B1.0AA |
| 4     | all 8 characters, incode right justified (Min 1 space) e.g. AB21.0AA, B1...0AA |

Add 8 to any of the above values to add a space between postcode and DPS.

### POSTCODEPART values

| Value | Description                                                               |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| +1    | Area code e.g. NW                                                         |
| +2    | District code (also known as "outward postcode" or "outcode") e.g. N17    |
| +4    | Sector code e.g. TD6 0                                                    |
| +8    | Sector code + character of postcode ending (not a valid partial postcode) |
| +16   | Full postcode e.g. NW3 2QW                                                |

| +64   | Postcode + DPS (Delivery Point Suffix) e.g. AB1 0PS1A                     |

Default = 87 = 64+16+4+2+1

e.g.

POSTCODE(PF=4,PP=16)

This sequence returns only a full postcode (with no DPS), with the incode right justified in an 8 character field.

### General address formatting options

The general options are specified in the formatting options as:

ADDR(option[=value[;value]...][,option]...)

| Option                                               | Abbrev | Values    | Description                                                                                                       | Default |

Most of the ADDR general options above are options in the [ADDRESSFORMAT] section of the Address Formatting Configuration File (waf.ini), however FIXED, DOUBLEQUOTE and LINENO are not.

### HYPHENATE Values

Hyphenate determines how number ranges within the Royal Mail PAF building name field are formatted.

| Value | Description                              |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 0     | No hyphenation, e.g. "10 12"             |
| 1     | Hyphenate with a dash (-), e.g. "10-12"  |
| 2     | Hyphenate with a slash (/), e.g. "10/12" |

### LINELEN

To specify the same length for all lines use:

ADDR(LL=length)

If different lengths need to be specified for individual lines, you can use the format :

ADDR(LL=lineno:length[;lineno:length]...)

e.g.

ADDR(LC=5,LL=1:20;2:30;3:30;4:30;5:10)

This sequence returns and address field of 5 lines where the first line is a maximum of 10 characters, the next three lines are a maximum of 30 characters and the last line is a maximum of 10 characters.

### Delimiters

DELIMITER and LINEDELIMITER may contain any number of the following special characters:

| Value | Meaning         |
| ----- | --------------- |
| M     | Comma           |
| I     | Semicolon       |
| N     | Colon           |
| E     | Equals          |
| S     | Space           |
| T     | Tab             |
| C     | Carriage Return |
| L     | Line Feed       |

DELIMITER and LINEDELIMITER may also contain quoted literal strings enclosed in quotation marks or apostrophes. These can be embedded in between the special characters above or used by themselves.

### Address element options

The following options are specified with a different value for each address element type, using the following form:

ADDR(type=option:value[;option:value]...)

Where type is one of the following address element names:

| Address Element Name | Abbrev |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| ORGANISATION         | ORG    |
| SUBBUILDING          | SUB    |
| BUILDINGNAME         | BLD    |
| BUILDINGNUMBER       | BNO    |
| DEPSTREET            | DST    |

| CONCATENATE | CO     | 0/1/2  | Controls concatenation of succeeding element to this element                            |
| ELIMINATE   | EL     | 0-9    | Controls elimination of elements from the address. Particularly where space is limited. |
| CHANGECASE  | CA     | 0/1/2  | Controls the character case                                                             |
| FORCELINES  | FO     | 0-11   | Specifies which address line to force each address elements into                        |

### CONCATENATE values

| Value | Description                                                        |

| 2     | Title Case  |

The default is to format all text in title case, except for the posttown and postcode, which will be in upper case.

### Locality options (UK datasets only)

The following options are specific to the locality name and are specified using the following form:

ADDR(LOC=option:value[;option:value]...)

| Option         | Abbrev | Values | Description                                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LONDONLOCALITY | LL     | n/a    | PAF Locality is blank for London, this option provides a London locality name derived from the outward part of the postcode |

This option can be specified in the [ADDRESSFORMAT] section of Address Formatting Configuration File as follows:

| Option                  | waf.ini [ADDRESSFORMAT] |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| LOCALITY=LONDONLOCALITY |                         |
| LONDONLOCALITY=Y        |                         |

### County options (UK datasets only)

The following options are specific to the county name and are specified using the following form:

ADDR(CNT=option:value[;option:value]...)

The options for formatting the county within the ADDR field are the same as the options for the COUNTY field. See “Formatting options”.

e.g.

ADDR(CNT=FC)

These options can be specified in the [ADDRESSFORMAT] section of Address Formatting Configuration File as follows:

| Option                 | waf.ini [ADDRESSFORMAT] |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| COUNTY=FULLCOUNTYNAME  | COUNTYNAME=1            |
| COUNTY=ADMINCOUNTYNAME | COUNTYNAME=2            |
| COUNTY=TRADCOUNTYNAME  | COUNTYNAME=3            |

#### Combining address formatting options

Where more than one option for an address element is required they can be combined as follows:

e.g.

ADDR(LC=6,LL=40,TWN=EL:1;CA:1,CNT=EL:1)

This sequence instructs the server to return the ADDR field with 6 lines of formatted address with a maximum line length of 40. The town name is never eliminated and is formatted in upper case. The county name is also never eliminated.

ADDR(LC=4,LL=30)

This sequence instructs the server to return the ADDR field with 4 lines of formatted address with a maximum line length of 30.

### DELIMITER values

| Value | Meaning         |
| ----- | --------------- |
| M     | Comma           |
| I     | Semicolon       |
| N     | Colon           |
| E     | Equals          |
