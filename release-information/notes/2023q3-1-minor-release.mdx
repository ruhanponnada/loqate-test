---

<Warning>
  Any customers using CASS2 must download the Q3.1 Loqate API update released on
  September 11th and the latest CASS data using the latest install manager. This
  is to ensure continuity of the CASS2 service due to several urgent bug fixes.
</Warning>

The setup wizard for the Local API can be obtained from our SFTP server. Please contact your account manager to retrieve the SFTP information. If you do not know who your account manager is, please contact the support team at support@loqate.com.

<Note>
  Note: If you are using command line to connect to the SFTP server, you will
  need to use ‘sftp user@site’ format instead of just ‘sftp site’.
</Note>

The 2023 Q3.1 Minor release makes improvements to the verification process and the quality of the results. Please remember to update the reference data. The improvements are tied to the data in the Global Knowledge Repository and the Local API.

**When updating the data, it is recommended to use a new data folder each time in order to ensure the latest dataset is installed properly.**

If you need any assistance with the upgrade of the Local API or the data update process, please contact GBG Loqate Support. The md5checksum can be used to help ensure the data packs have been fully downloaded.
