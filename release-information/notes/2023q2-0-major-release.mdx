**Important Notice – From this release 2023 Q2.0 we have now removed the BatchUI tool that use to be an option delivered when you run the API installer.**

The setup wizard for the Local API can be obtained from our SFTP server. Please contact your account manager to retrieve the SFTP information. If you do not know who your account manager is, please contact the support team at support@loqate.com.

<Note>
  Note: If you are using command line to connect to the SFTP server, you will
  need to use ‘sftp user@site’ format instead of just ‘sftp site’.
</Note>
The 2023Q2.0 Major release makes improvements to the verification process and
the quality of the results. Please remember to update the reference data. The
improvements are tied to the data in the Global Knowledge Repository and the
Local API.

**When updating the data, it is recommended to use a new data folder each time in order to ensure the latest dataset is installed properly.**

If you need any assistance with the upgrade of the Local API or the data update process, please contact GBG Loqate Support. The md5checksum can be used to help ensure the data packs have been fully downloaded.

If you would like to see a list of md5checksums for this release please visit the [md5 hash value guide](/support/md5-hash-values-guide/) or contact your account manager.
