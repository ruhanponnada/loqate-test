title: 2024 Q1.1 API Minor release and 202403 Data release Notes
---

From April Loqate will introduce a global enhanced dataset that will be available to all customers. Initially this dataset will contain a new additional address element to indicate if a property is Residential or Commercial or of mixed use, where we have access to that information. This will be rolled out over the rest of this year for the countries where this data is and becomes available. Details of this will be added to the monthly data release notes.

Release Details
The setup wizard for the Local API can be obtained from our SFTP server. Please contact your account manager to retrieve the SFTP information. If you do not know who your account manager is, please contact the support team at support@loqate.com.

<Note>
  Note: If you are using the command line to connect to the SFTP server, you
  will need to use ‘sftp user@site’ format instead of just ‘sftp site’.
</Note>

The 2024 Q1.1 Minor Release makes improvements to the verification process and the quality of the results. These enhancements are tied to both the data and the API so please update both.

Loqate has resolved several data related support cases as part of this release and details can be found in the Data Release Notes.

If you need any assistance with the upgrade of the API or the data update process, please contact GBG Loqate Support. The md5checksum can be used to help ensure the data packs have been fully downloaded.
