import { CustomWarning } from "/snippets/CustomWarning.mdx";

The Loqate Account Section provides a full suite of usage reports in the
Reporting page, which you can find
[here](https://account.loqate.com/account#/NewReporting/). In this article we
will explain what each piece of reporting functionality can be used for, and how
best to keep track of your usage.

We recommend you regularly check the usage for each API key - i.e. how many
requests are being made and what the running costs are - in order to maintain
visibility of how your services are being used.

Please note that the Charged Requests field in two of the following reports
represents the number of API calls that have been made, not the volume of
transactions being processed in a batch.

- For Capture or Bulk Email Validation, this figure shows the number of
  addresses or email addresses included in a call
- With Verify's batch capability, be aware that this figure doesn't represent
  the number of addresses verified in a batch request

#### Main report

The first report you'll see on this page shows the total number and total cost
of charged requests over a given time period.

You can run this report using various date ranges - note that the date range you
select here will apply to all of the other reports on this page too.

Here's what it looks like run for three days:

And here's a month - as you can see the list of data underneath the chart
increases:

#### Usage Summary by Service

This report breaks down usage by product, based on the data range selected
above. It defaults to All keys, but you can select a specific key if you only
want to see the usage for services using that key.

The **Product Family** column shows the overall product grouping, while the
Service column shows the specific endpoint. So for example, both Find and
Retrieve calls will be listed as 'Addressing_Capture' under Product Family, but
you'll see the separate endpoints under Service.

#### Summary Usage by Key

This report breaks down usage for each of your API keys. If you hover the mouse
over each key though, you can see which product family it's been used for.

**A note on terminology**

Please note that the **Charged Requests** field in these summaries represents
the number of API calls that have been made, not the volume of transactions
being processed in a batch.

For certain products (such as Capture and Bulk Email Validation) you will see a
number of records in brackets, like this:

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/29556d31-image2023-4-14_15-50-24.png" />
</Frame>

This represents the fact that one API call might contain multiple addresses or
emails, in which case it will be shown as a single request with multiple
records.
