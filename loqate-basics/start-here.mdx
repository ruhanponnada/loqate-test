If you're just starting with Loqate, you can use this page to orient yourself
and get started with your integration. We'll take you through five quick steps
to get up and running, including making your first calls to the Loqate APIs,
then provide some further reading at the end.

#### 1. Create a Loqate account

If you haven't already,
[sign up for a Loqate account](https://account.loqate.com/register/).

Signing up for a new account gives you a 14 day free trial, which gives you the
opportunity to test your integration, experiment with our range of products, and
experience the practical benefits they can bring to your organisation.

#### 2. Choose an integration method

You can integrate with Loqate in various ways, from auto-generated code snippets
to full API integrations. The option you choose will be determined by the nature
of your business and what you want to achieve.

For the purposes of this article, and for the sake of simplicity, we're going to
assume you'll at least partially be using an API integration, but see our
[Ways to Integrate](/loqate-basics/ways-to-integrate/ "Ways to integrate") page
for more information about all of the options.

  We have a no-code option for Address Capture, Email Validation and Phone
  Validation, which we refer to as a **Tag** setup. See our [Ways to
  Integrate](/loqate-basics/ways-to-integrate/) page for more details, or our
  [Quick Setup
  Guide](/guides/address-email-and-phone-verification/quick-setup-guide) to get
  started.
</CustomInfo>

#### 3. Create an API key

All Loqate services require an API key for authentication purposes, so you'll
need to create one before you can start making any API calls.

You can set up generic API keys or service-specific keys, and then apply various
limits and restrictions to each, but to begin with we recommend creating a
generic API key for the purposes of initial testing and setup.

To do this, click on the Add Service + button at the top of the screen in your
Account:

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/28c9337a-api-keys-1-blurred.png" />
</Frame>

From the next screen select th&#x65;**&#x20;API Key** option, then you'll see
your newly-created key. Take note of the key (which we've blurred out in the
image below for security purposes), but for the time being you don't need to
worry about any of the other options.

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/d9d0dbe1-new-api-key-blurred.png" />
</Frame>

See our
[Creating API Keys](/loqate-basics/creating-api-keys/ "Creating API keys") page
for full details of creating API keys and the various available options.

#### 4. Make some API calls

If you've chosen a Tag setup (see the
[Ways to Integrate](/loqate-basics/ways-to-integrate/ "Ways to integrate") page
for more details about this), you can go ahead and test the form(s) on your
website to see how Address, Email and/or Phone Validation works.

If you're going to be using APIs, the next step is to make some test calls using
your new API key.

Here are some simple examples, which you can run in Postman or in a browser.
**Make sure you swap the placeholder API key (AA11-AA11-AA11-AA11) in each for
your own API key.**

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="Capture Find">


    A Find call uses a text search to find addresses and places - this returns an address ID which can then be used in a Retrieve call. This example is looking for addresses containing 'GBG' and the postcode 'WR5 3DA':

    ```bash
    https://api.addressy.com/Capture/Interactive/Find/v1.10/json3.ws?Key=AA11-AA11-AA11-AA11&Text=GBG wr53da
    ```

    Here's what that call should return:

    ```bash
    {
        "Items": [
            {
                "Id": "GB|RM|B|55943629",
                "Type": "Address",
                "Text": "G B G, Waterside, Basin Road",
                "Highlight": "0-5;11-14,15-18",
                "Description": "Worcester, WR5 3DA"   }
        ]
    }
    ```



    Make note of the "Id", which you'll use in the following Retrieve call.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Capture Retrieve">

    Once you've completed a Find call and have the outputted address ID, you can use that in a Return call to get the details of that address. Here's an example using the address ID generated in the previous call:

    ```bash
    https://api.addressy.com/Capture/Interactive/Retrieve/v1.2/json3.ws? Key=AA11-AA11-AA11-AA11&Id=GB|RM|B|26772356
    ```

    Here's what that call should return:

    ```bash
    {
        "Items": [
            {
                "Id": "GB|RM|B|55943629",

#### 5. Check your usage

Once you've made a few API calls, head over to the
[Reporting](https://account.loqate.com/Account/#/NewReporting/) page in your
account. Here you'll be able to see usage summaries per key (or across your
account as a whole), showing both charged and free requests and, if appropriate,
the total cost of them so far. For example:

![reporting-blurred](/images/f4c7bf4c-reporting-blurred.png)

We recommend you regularly check the usage on your keys, to maintain visibility
of how your services are being used.

For full details of these reports, see our
[Monitoring Account Usage](/loqate-basics/monitoring-account-usage/ "Monitoring Account Usage")
page.

#### Other important considerations

Once you've set up and tested an API key, you can go ahead and put together your
full integration. Some further considerations to take into account include:

- **What all the available service options are:&#x20;**&#x74;here are lots of
  Loqate services available, so
  [read through this page](/loqate-basics/list-of-endpoints/ "List of endpoints")
  to see what you might find useful.
- **How to stay secure:** we provide a range of features to help you ensure that
  your integration is as secure as possible.
  [See this page for full details.](/loqate-basics/api-security/ "API Security")
