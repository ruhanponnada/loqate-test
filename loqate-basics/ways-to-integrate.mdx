You have multiple options when it comes to integrating with Loqate, and in this
article we'll look at what those options are, along with their pros and cons.

The two main integration options are:

- **Using Tags:** this option is available for Address Capture, Email
  Verification and Phone Verification
- **Using APIs:** this option is available for all Loqate products and services

There's also a third option available for certain situations, which is
**Integrations by Platform**. You can use Address Capture, Verify, Email
Verification and Phone Verification via pre-built integrations with various
tools, including Shopware and Microsoft Dynamics 365. This offers a slightly
different approach to integrating with Loqate natively, useful if you already
use one of the tools that we integrate with.

  The main focus of this article is on Tag and API integrations, although we've
  included some information about third-party integrations too, and a link out
  to the specific documentation.

These options are not mutually exclusive, so you can use more than one in
conjunction if you want.

Regardless of which option(s) you choose, you can make changes in the Account
Section for security, customisation and certain features.

#### Use cases

You know your business best, and what your requirements are. Here are a few
examples though of possible use cases, and which of the Tag or API integration
option might be best for each:

| Business Type            | Specifics                                 | Recommended option |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Financial business       | Strictly regulated                        | APIs               |
| Large ecommerce business | Requires considerable customisation       | APIs               |
| Very small business      | Uses simple web forms                     | Tag                |
| Small business           | Uses cloud-based tools for creating forms | Tag or APIs        |

#### Tag Integrations

The simplest way of setting up Address Verification, Email Verification and
Phone Verification is by using the Tag method, which uses
automatically-generated code snippets that you can insert into your website to
set these services up.

This method is designed for simple webforms, allowing you to set up standard
configurations via your Loqate account.

**Pros**:

- **Speed:&#x20;**&#x79;ou can get started quickly and easily
- **Simplicity:** there's no need for technical know-how, as the functionality
  comes from our JavaScript solution and CSS

**Cons**:

- **Customisation:** unlike API integrations, you don't have as much control
  over how your integration works as it will always be based off our JavaScript
  and CSS
- **Security:** adding JavaScript to your website, while an effective way of
  adding new functionality, does come with some security considerations, and as
  such may not be appropriate for all circumstances. See our Security article
  for more information

Check out our
[Quick Setup Guide](/guides/address-email-and-phone-verification/quick-setup-guide "Quick")
for simple instructions that walk you through how to get set up with Tag
integrations.

From an additional security perspective, consider using the Limits functionality
to restrict your integration by IP address, service and/or URL. See our Security
article for more details.

#### API Integrations

All Loqate products can be integrated using our APIs, which are also available
for Address Verification, Email Verification and Phone Verification for more
flexible integrations.

**Pros:**

- **Control:** you're not constrained by any existing integrations or ways of
  working, and you don't need to rely on our preset JavaScript or CSS
- **Customisation:&#x20;**&#x79;ou can shape your customer journey however you
  see fit

**Cons:**

- **Complexity:&#x20;**&#x41;PI integrations require technical knowledge and
  resources
- **Speed:** it takes time to implement and test API integrations

Check out our [API documentation](/apis/ "APIs") for details of all of the
Loqate APIs.

You can still take advantage of all of the security functionality available in
the Account Section - see our [Security](/loqate-basics/api-security/) article
for more details.

#### Integrations by Platform

As well as the option of creating your own integration using the Tag and/or API
methods, we also have a range of pre-built integrations which allow you to
access Address Capture, Verify, Email Validation and Phone Validation within
various tools. We're always working on new integrations, but some of our current
integrations include:

- [Microsoft Dynamics 365](https://www.loqate.com/en-gb/integrations/microsoft-dynamics-365/)
- [SAP](https://www.loqate.com/en-gb/integrations/sap-commerce-cloud/)
- [Shopware](https://www.loqate.com/en-gb/integrations/shopware/)

If you already use any of these tools, you can use our pre-built integrations to
quickly and easily add Loqate functionality to your site.

Check out our [Integrations documentation](/guides/ "Guides") for details of how
to get up and running.
