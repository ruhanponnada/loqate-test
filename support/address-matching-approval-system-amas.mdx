### AMAS Installation

Please ensure Loqate is installed **outside** of Program Files. Even if you enable read/write permissions while inside Program Files, there may still be permissions issues.

The installation for AMAS requires installation of the API and AMAS data packs. The AMAS API and AMAS Data are platform dependent.

- **AMAS API:&#xA0;**&#x54;he respective library files for corresponding platform must be uploaded in the same location as the Loqate API installation directory. For Windows platforms, you would also need the VC71 redistributable libraries found in (VC71) folder.

* **AMAS data:&#xA0;**&#x41;MAS data are platform specific. Therefore, respective data for the corresponding platform must be uploaded. The data files should end up inside data amas subdirectory where ‘data’ is the Loqate data installation directory.

Navigate to your Loqate installation folder (where Loqate API file: lqtBatch is located)

1. Run the following command (the dot at the end is mandatory) to set the environmentpath to that folder:\
   `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.`
2. Then run the below command: (Replacethe directory path value with your Loqate data folder location)\
   `./lqtbatch -d <your data folder>`
