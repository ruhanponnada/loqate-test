An output record will contain the following:

A [subset of Verify fields](/support/verify-fields-available-when-running-cass2/), with the following exception:

For on-premises CASS, the AVC and AQI fields will be populated by a default value “Z00-Z00-Z0-000” and “Z” respectively. Customers should use the CASS output fields DPVConfirmedIndicator, DPVFootnotes, and ResultsString to determine the quality and accuracy of processed record. Loqate Cloud CASS customers will see the AVC populated.
By design, under some conditions the CASS engine will return fields from the input address that are not from the CASS lookup, but retained from the input. In these cases, the input address includes additional information that is not in the USPS reference dataset, and not verified, but which is important for correct delivery (for example, “deliver to front desk”).
Please feel free to reach out to Loqate Support if you have any questions.

**The table below displays the CASS fields currently available in the Loqate API.**

| DPVFootnotes           | Delivery Point Validation footnotes. There can be one or more two-character footnotes. This field is used together with the DPVConfirmedIndicator field to understand the input address' validity and deliverability AA – Street, city, state and ZIP are valid. Address matched a record in the ZIP+4 file. A1 – Address not found in the ZIP+4 file. Address is invalid BB – All address components are confirmed. Address is a deliverable address C1 – Address is a deliverable address after dropping the subbuilding number from the input address. Subbuilding is required. CC – Address is a deliverable address after dropping the subbuilding number from the input address. Subbuilding is not required. F1 – Address matched to a military address G1 – Address matched to a general delivery address IA – Informed Address identified. This replaces the recipient's name and street address with a special code in the address block. The only information that most people will be able to see about the recipient will be their city, state, and ZIP5. N1 – Found a DPV match to the premise number but the subbuilding number is missing from the input record M1 – Premise number is missing M3 – Premise number is invalid P1 – PO, RR, HC Box number missing P3 – PO, RR, HC Box number is invalid PB – Input address matched to a post office box street address RR – Address matched to CMRA and PMB designator is present R1 – Address matched to CMRA but PMB designator is not present R7: Input address matched to a physical address that does not receive delivery from the USPS (R777 or R779) TA – Input address premise matched by dropping trailing alpha U1 – Address matched to a unique ZIP Code |

| PMBType                | Private Mailbox Type will be appended to the PrimaryAddressLine field. For example, if the Private Mailbox Value was "PMB 100", then PMBType would be "PMB". PMBs allow individuals or offices a private mailbox to simplify internal mail distribution, retain privacy, or have convenient hours of mail pickup. They can be rented as needed through a commercial mail receiving agency (CMRA), which may be more cost-effective than renting a box at the post office.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
