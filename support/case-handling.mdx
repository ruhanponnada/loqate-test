| Type     | **A Defect is:** <br/>- A failure of the software to perform to a documented functional or performance standard<br/>- An unexpected termination event<br/>- A degradation of the supplied input data with report codes that indicate correct output<br/>- A failure to verify correctly formatted and standardized input data which exists in the reference dataset<br/><br/>**An Enhancement** is where the software is lacking a desired ability, but where the software is providing internally consistent output. The customer is able to make use the software for other purposes as normal. Examples of enhancement requests are:<br/><br/>- A request to process particular input data, unless the output to that process for the given input data falls under the definition of a defect<br/>- A request to process particular input data where that record does not exist within the reference dataset<br/><br/>**A Question** is an issue either with the usage of the software or the interpretation of the returned information and report codes. |
| Priority | **Critical Priority** is used to identify a critical defect in a production environment. The customer cannot use the Product and there is a critical impact on the customer's operations which requires an immediate solution.<br/><br/>**High Priority** is used to identify a major defect. The customer can use the Product, but an important function is not available or the customer's operations are severely impacted.<br/><br/>**Medium Priority** is used to identify a minor defect. The customer can use the Product with some functional restrictions, but it does not have a severe or critical impact on the customer's operations.<br/><br/>**Low Priority** is used to identify a minor defect that is not significant to the customer's operations. The customer may be able to circumvent the problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Other Definitions

A **Reference Dataset** is the integrated third-party data set used to provide a definitive source to verify input data. For address verification this is often sourced from the relevant Postal Authority. Different reference datasets have different strengths and weaknesses, fields such as Organization, PostBox, PremiseNumber, Thoroughfare, SubBuilding, Building, PostalCode, etc, maybe either unavailable or only partially populated. A full list of dataset contents per country is available at https://support.loqate.com/datacoveragesummary/.

An **Acceptance Level** is required since, as an expert system, it may be necessary to make a determination to have more common input data structures process successfully at the expense of less common structures. This applies to data processing changes, and requires that at least 80% of the changes due to a particular update are improvements.
