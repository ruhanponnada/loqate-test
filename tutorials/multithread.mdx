title: "Loqate Multithreading Sample Code in Java"
---

## Overview

This sample code below is provided as a reference to developers that want to use the Loqate Engine in a multithreaded environment.

The LqtMultithreadTestDriver class is responsible for creating multiple threads.

The LqtThreadRunner class provides an example of the Loqate Engine instance variables and method calls suggested on a per-thread basis. The processRecordSegment(â€¦) method of the LqtThreadRunner assumes the user wants to process different segments of the input records provided. That method may be modified depending on the customer application.
