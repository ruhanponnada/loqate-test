**AMAS Error code information:&#xA0;**

For the AMAS process, the ErrorCode field lets us determine whether PPM rules have taken place. An ErrorCode of 4 indicates that all of the fields were matched correctly (i.e. no error), which means the DPID matches the entire input address and PPM has not been used:

If the ErrorCode is 5 or 19,the address is respectively not verified or partially verified at the SubBuilding level, and PPM has been used to match to the Primary Point address:

If the ErrorCode is 20 or 21, the address is only verified up to Thoroughfare or Locality respectively, and the output address and DPID both reflect this verification level. Although we cannot determine whether PPM has been used in this case, the output address does not contain information beyond what can be found with the DPID:

If the ErrorCode is 211 through 216, at least one field has been changed between the input and the output, likely because of a spelling error or a blank field:

We cannot determine whether PPM has been used based on this ErrorCode alone, but we can use the corrected output address to fix the input spelling error and get a new ErrorCode that allows us to determine whether PPM has been used. The error codes correspond to the following spelling errors:

211 -> Thoroughfare name - The street name was corrected<br/>
212 -> Locality - The suburb/town name was corrected<br/>
213 -> PostalCode - The postal code was corrected<br/>
214 -> AdministrativeArea - The state/territory was corrected<br/>
215 -> Thoroughfare type - The street type (ST, RD, etc) was corrected<br/>
216 -> Thoroughfare direction - The street direction (N, S, etc) was corrected
