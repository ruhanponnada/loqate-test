## **Notes:**

For output field RESULT, it will either be “VALID”, or an address classification and series of three character codes indicating the status of individual address components. Each code will be a two-digit numeric that identify the address component plus one character status indicator. There can be many of these three character codes.

For example a RESULT of ‘C17M’ indicates:

- C = Invalid Correctable Address
- 17M = The Suite Identifier is missing.

Another example, a RESULT of ‘N10I11I62M’ indicates:

- N = Invalid Non-Correctable Address
- 10I = Complete street information is Inconsistent/Incorrect
- 11I = Civic Number is Inconsistent/Incorrect
- 62M = Province is Missing

Here are the classification, address components, and address components status:
