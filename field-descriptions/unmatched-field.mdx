title: "Unmatched Field"
---

The Unmatched field is used to place all the input data that cannot be parsed as part of an address. Generally Loqate will tend to assume that unidentified words are either Building or Organization names, but if it has a large degree of confidence that a particular item is not part of the address data it will place it into the Unmatched field, as in the example below.
