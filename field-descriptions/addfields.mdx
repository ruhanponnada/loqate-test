Loqate’s address structure is based on the OASIS Extensible Address Language (xAL) version 2.0, adapted to suit a flattened record structure.
Some countries have more complex addressing structures than others.

As such, the use of individual fields will vary based on the input country and the available reference data.
The following fields are recognized, [in] designates a field that can be used on input, [out] designates a field that may be present on output, and [in,out] designates that a field can be used for both input and output.

Please Note that the AdministrativeArea should be the full name or the postal authority accepted code. For example, ‘New York’ or ‘NY’ in the US, and “VALLE DEL CAUCA” in Colombia (there is no postal abbreviation). ISO-3166 administrative area codes (e.g. ‘CO-VAC’ for ‘VALLE DEL CAUCA’ in Colombia) are not recognized on input andshould not be used but can be returned in our output via our enhanced [ISO-3166 dataset](/support/data-enhancement-administrativearea-iso-2-code/) Field descriptions for our geocode and certified products can be accessed from [the main field descriptions menu](/field-descriptions/).

### Primary Address Fields

Primary fields (also known as atomic fields) are always populated and verified when appropriate.

| **Address [in,out]**                                                 | This field holds the full address, correctly formatted for mailing in the relevant country, including line breaks specified using the AddressLineSeparator option.Do not use ‘Address’ as input when running CASS. The preferred input for CASS is (Address1 + Locality + AdministrativeArea + PostalCode + Country). However, (Address1 + Address2 + Country) will also work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Examples of recommended input are listed below: <br/> - Address lines input: (Address1, Address2, Address3 OR Address) + Country<br/>- Address lines + geographical: Address1, Address2, Address3 + Locality + AdministrativeArea + PostalCode + Country **Note**: If the input values (Thoroughfare/premise) are entered on separate lines, the user may receive an unexpected outcome as this is not in a recommended input format.Example: <br/> - Premise+Address1+Locality+Postalcode+country |
| **ID [in,out]**                                                      | Optional.

### Sub-Fields

Sub-fields are populated when the level of parsing detail exists for the particular country. Sub-fields are only verified when they are supported by the reference data for the particular country. Therefore they are not guaranteed to be populated or verified in the output. For example, a Sub-field may be populated from the parsed input, but may not be able to be verified. Please check the associated [Field Status](/report-codes/fieldstatus/) to confirm.
