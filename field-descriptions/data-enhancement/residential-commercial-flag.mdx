Loqate are working on adding a residential/commercial flag for our primary countries.

We made this flag available for these countries – **Australia, Belgium, Canada and the USA** with the **202407** data release, and we will update this page when we add this flag for more countries.

The **_ResCom_Flag_** field can have the following values – Res, Com, R/C or Unk (Unknown)
