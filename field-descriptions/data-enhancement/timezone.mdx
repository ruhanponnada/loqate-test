## What are Time Zones?

Time Zone refers to the local time of a region or a country. The local time within a time zone is defined by its offset (difference) from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), the world’s time standard, ranging from UTC-12:00 to UTC +14:00.
Some countries or regions use Daylight Savings Time (DST) for part of the year during spring and summer. During DST, our clocks are forwarded an hour, so daylight ends at later time of the day.

### Coverage and Data
