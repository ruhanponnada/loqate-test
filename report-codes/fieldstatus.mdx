### 0: fsNotApplicable

Field is not applicable to return field status.

### 1: fsVerifiedNoChange

Field has been verified using relevant reference data, no changes were needed.

### 2: fsVerifiedAliasChange

Field has been verified using relevant reference data, an alias change was made during parsing (see fsIdentifiedAlias).

### 3: fsVerifiedSmallChange

Field has been verified using relevant reference data, a small spelling change was made.

### 4: fsVerifiedLargeChange

Field has been verified using relevant reference data, a large spelling change was made.

### 5: fsAdded

Field has been added using relevant reference data.

### 6: fsIdentifiedNoChange

Field has been identified using relevant lexicon data, no changes were needed. e.g. an input value of ‘PO Box 1234’ may be identifiable as a PostBox, but if it is unable to be verified then a status of fsIdentifiedNoChange will be returned.

### 7: fsIdentifiedAlias

Field has been identified using relevant lexicon data, an alias change was made. e.g. an input value of ‘Avnue’ may be identifiable as an alias to the ThoroughfareType ‘Ave’.

### 8: fsIdentifiedContext

Field has been identified using relevant context rules. e.g. an input Address of ‘123 sdovnsdv San Bruno CA USA’ may identify the word ‘sdovnsdv’ as a Thoroughfare, but only because of the context in which it appears (after an identifiable PremiseNumber, and before an identifiable Locality).

### 9: fsEmpty

### 10: fsUnrecognized

Field statuses propagate up the field hierarchy, combining under the following rules:
