  <Accordion title="Which way of integrating Address Capture will work best for me?">
    There are three main ways to integrate Address Capture, and which method is most appropriate will depend on your business and what you want to achieve. Our [**Ways to Integrate** page](/loqate-basics/ways-to-integrate/) takes you through each of the different methods.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I best take the fields from an Address Capture response and map them back to my address fields?">

    We provide each address in three different formats:

    * **Address label:&#xA0;**&#x67;reat for displaying the complete formatted address in a single field or on an envelope
    * **Address lines (recommended):** use these where you have multiple address line fields. Used alongside Company, town and postal code fields most commonly
    * **Address elements**:&#xA0;&#x65;ach individual element of the address (e.g. building, street) where you need to separate our the lines of an address into individual fields

    Any one of the above approaches will lead to a complete address. The full set of fields can be found in our [API documentation pages](/apis/address-capture/).

    Note: It is best not to mix fields from the different formats, as this can lead to missing or duplicated information.

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Should I make my API calls client-side or server-side?">
  When deciding how to integrate the Address Capture APIs, your decision should
  take into account performance, technical complexity and, most importantly,
  security. Whether or not to make calls client-side or server-side is part of
  the decision-making process regarding security; our [API Security
  page](/loqate-basics/api-security/#integration-pptions)
  has a section relating to integration options, which should help you decide
  which option is best for you.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title= "Is it possible to get latitude and longitude coordinates when I retrieve an address?">

    Yes - various additional fields are available, when you get an address from our Retrieve endpoint, and (where the data is available) this includes latitude and Longitude.

    When using the API, this is achieved by the field*x*format parameters within the Retrieve method. In order to request the latitude and longitude you need to add them into the parameters, like below:

    ```javascript
    &field1format={Latitude}&field2format={Longitude}
    ```

    This will then Return Latitude and Longitude in Field1 and Field2 in the response respectively.

    If consuming the service via [the Tag method](/loqate-basics/ways-to-integrate/), you can enter the same input into the mappings wizard.

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="    Browser auto-fill is interfering with my address lookup, can I turn it off?">

    Yes - for the best experience when using Address Capture, we recommend you turn off the browser autofill functionality for address form fields.

    Firstly, below where the Loqate Tag script has been placed on the page, insert the following JavaScript code snippet:

    ```javascript
    pca.on("load", function(type, id, control){
      var isChrome = !!window.chrome || !!window.chrome.webstore;
      if (isChrome == true){
        for (i=0; control.fields.length > i; i++){
          pca.getElement(control.fields[i].element).autocomplete = "GBGTEST";
        };
      };
    });
    ```

    On the Address Form Fields, we have found success in adding the attribute **autocomplete="none"**, to disable the browser's autofill. For example:

    ```javascript
    autocomplete="none" placeholder="Start typing your address"  autofocus name=“searchTerm” />
    ```

    We recommended that you test this code across multiple popular web browsers.
