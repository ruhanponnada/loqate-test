  <Accordion
  title="What is Geolocation?"
  >
    Loqate's Geolocation feature enables mobile users in the UK to find their location with a single tap, instead of needing to type in an address. Using the geographical location of the mobile device, Geolocation returns latitude and longitude coordinates alongside the full, correctly-formatted address.

    The radius is set to 50m by default, but can be adjusted to anything from 1 to 200 metres.

    If using a Tag integration, you'll need to [contact the Loqate support team](https://www.loqate.com/en-gb/contact/customer-support/#form) to adjust the radius. In other integrations you can set the radius when making a call to the service.

    The maximum number of addresses returned is set to 10 by default (using the API - in a Tag integration it's set to 5), but can be adjusted to anything from 1 to 50.

    If using a Tag integration, you'll need to [contact the Loqate support team](https://www.loqate.com/en-gb/contact/customer-support/#form) to adjust the maximum number of addresses. In other integrations you can set this when making a call to the service.
