    Do you provide development accounts to allow me to create my integration?

    Yes we do, although we can’t provide unrestricted development accounts under the terms of our agreement with our data providers. However, within reason, we can provide you with test credit for development purposes. We also have a postcode: WR5 3DA - which you can use for repetitive testing without consuming credit. If you require a high-volume test environment please [contact us](https://www.loqate.com/en-gb/contact/) to discuss your options.

  <Accordion
  title="How can I update the details you hold for my company?"

  <Accordion
  title="How do you ensure the service stays Live at all times?"
  >
    Service continuity is of prime important to us. That's why we've taken considerable steps to ensure that Loqate is always available:

    * 2 completely autonomous data centres
    * Load balanced servers in each data centre
    * Data centres employ fully diverse routing and multiple carriers
    * Automatic failover between servers and between data centres
    * No single point of failure

    All this means that even a catastrophic failure of a data centre can be tolerated and will not impact on the availability of Loqate Predict. Traffic will simply reroute to the other data centre within 60 seconds.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
  title="I received an error message when trying to access the service, what should I do?"
  >

    We have a [comprehensive list](/faqs/common-account-errors/ "Common account errors") of error messages and their resolutions. If that doesn't help, you can contact our support team and we’ll be happy to help you.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
  title="I use your on-premise solution. Can you offer me a backup?"
  >

    Yes, any customer using an on-premise service can hook into the hosted service if you have a problem with your own servers. This is simply a case of changing the IP address that the service points towards.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
  title="Can I use my Loqate account for more than one website/service?"
  >

    Yes, there's no need to register for each website or service you want to use; in your account you can create separate 'keys' for use on different websites or even different businesses. If you are integrating our services for clients on different projects you might like to consider creating a [reseller account](https://www.loqate.com/en-gb/partners/reseller/ "Reseller") where you can manage 'child' accounts separately.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
  title="What is the average response time of the service?"

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion

  <Accordion
  title="How will I know when my licence needs renewing?"
  >

    All our licences are valid for a year. We will automatically invoice you when your licence is due for renewal (typically around 60 days before - to give you plenty of time to process payment).

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
  title="I don’t need my Loqate service any more, what do I do?"
  >

    There is no obligation to keep using our service. Annual user licences will simply stop working, as will pay-as-you-go credit. We do not provide refunds for any unused credit on your account. If you have been supplied with raw data, in order to comply with Royal Mail licensing you will need to complete a Data Destruction Form - confirming that you won’t use the data once your licence expires. Please [contact us](https://www.loqate.com/en-gb/contact/) for more information if this affects you.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
  title="I have many employees but they don’t all need your service, do I have to buy a user license for them all?"
  >

    No you don’t. Many Loqate services work on a pay-per-click (PPC) basis, so you buy credit that’s shared by everyone that needs it. If you need user licences, then you need the correct number of licences for the number of staff using the service. We can advise you of the most cost effective option for your business if you [contact us](https://www.loqate.com/en-gb/contact/).

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
  title="I’ve renewed my licence but why am I still getting 'Licence key is no longer valid' alerts?"
  >

    Sometimes when you renew your annual licence, a new licence key will be generated, rather than extending the existing licence (typically when the renewal is done at the last minute, or if payment is late). To reactivate the service, simply drop in the new key. This will have been emailed to you when you renewed the service. If you are unsure of the key you can view it by [logging into your account](https://account.locate.com) and selecting 'All services'. If you would prefer to have the old key reactivated, please [contact us](https://www.loqate.com/en-gb/contact/) and we'll see if we can help.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
  title="I’ve accepted your End User Licence Agreement (EULA) why are you asking me to accept another from a different provider?"
  >

    The data that we provide to you is owned by other suppliers such as: Royal Mail and Ordnance Survey. As an approved reseller, Loqate must ensure our customers comply with the terms of business of our data providers. This is why you might need to sign an extra licence agreement.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
  title="What is my account code?"
  >
    You can find your account code in the 'Welcome to Loqate' email that is sent to you upon registration. This is a unique code and you will need it to log in, so make sure to keep it safe. Accidentally deleted the email? Don't worry, just [contact our Support team](https://www.loqate.com/en-gb/contact/customer-support/#form) and they will help.
