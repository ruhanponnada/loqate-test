The following commands can be used to control and manipulate the Loqate process or output. These are considered advanced functions, and we recommend that server options are used in custom workflows.

**CASS2 releated server options added to the bottom of this list.**

| Server Option                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| AddressLineSeparator             | Used to specify the string which will separate the output address lines within the output Address field (default`<br>`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| AutocompleteIndexOnly            | This option allows the user to specify whether the search process should use Powersearch auto-complete index ONLY. The default is OFF. The option should be set to 0 or OFF to allow search tool to also use the parser and match tool when the auto-complete index cannot find any results. The option should be set to 1 or ON to allow the search tool to use the Powersearch auto-complete index files. This can also be used as a process option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| CasingIgnoreFields               | Used to specify the fields that should be ignored by the OutputCasing option. System default is “ID,PostalCode,PostalCodePrimary,PostalCodeSecondary,ISO3166-2,ISO3166-3,PostBox,PostBoxNumber,PostBoxType,\_L,Latitude,Longitude,GeoAccuracy,GeoDistance,AVC,AQI,HyphenClass,MatchedFieldList,DPS,CountryCode,Outputstatus,FormattedAddress”. Additionally, the following datasets also add AdministrativeArea to the default values: AUS, BRA, CAN, ITA, MEX, CHE, and USA. Currently system defaults cannot be overridden, but country-level values will be ignored when CasingIgnoreFields is used. Please re-use “AdministrativeArea” as a value to retain the default behavior.                                                                                                                                         |
| CassCompanyName                  | This option is set within the loqate.ini file. This will allow the Loqate engine to print the Company Name value in the CASS and PS3553 reports. Please note, if a value has not been specified, then the default value will be ‘LOQATE’.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| ContextResultCacheSize           | Used to specify how many sets of context results should be cached in memory. This cache is a cost-based cache based on processing time, meaning that the slowest context analyses have their results cached. Default 0. Values up to around 5,000 are relevant, but the memory usage and performance gain will be dependent on the supplied input data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ContextCountryCacheSize          | Used to specify the number of MRU countries to generate ContextResult caches for. On an unsorted multi-country file a value of around 10 may be relevant, but the memory usage and performance gain will be dependent on the supplied input data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| NewSearchPrefered                | If this option is set to TRUE or ON, New Search is executed before the Old Search during execution of the Search Process. Typically if the input is nearly complete, New Search is preferred to complete the search and the option should be set to TRUE or ON. If the input is quite partial and is not nearly a complete address, Old Search is preferred and the option should be set to FALSE or OFF. Default option is FALSE or OFF.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| QueryResultCacheSize             | Used to specify how many sets of query results should be cached in memory. This cache is a cost-based cache based on query time, meaning that the slowest queries have their results cached. Default 0. Values up to around 5,000 are relevant, but the memory usage and performance gain will be dependent on the supplied input data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| RangeDecompose                   | Used to specify how to expand ranges such as premise numbers and sub building numbers. Valid values are ‘Match’ (returning only the value matching the input query), ‘Range’ (returning a human-readable range, e.g. ‘1-9 Odd’), or ‘Full’ (expanding out the range into its constituent numbers, e.g. ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’, ‘4’, ‘5’).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ReferenceDatasetCacheSize        | Used to specify the number of MRU reference datasets to cache.

| ReferencePageCacheSize           | Used to specify the number of MRU pages to cache from each individual reference dataset. Default value is 12, each page equates to approximately 5Mb of memory use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ReturnDataType                   | Valid values are Complete (default) or Verified. If set to Verified, the output from a Search process will only include data that has been verified against the available reference data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ReturnVerifiedFieldsOnly         | This option will return only verified fields, meaning that it will remove anything that isn’t verified from any field. SuppressUnmatched option will only suppress the unverified components in the Address field. Default No, meaning all fields will be returned. This can be specified on a per-country basis, with the added ability to specify fields to ignore during the check, using the following syntax ReturnVerifiedFieldsOnly=[:;;…;][,:;…;,…,]. e.g. ReturnVerifiedFieldsOnly=BE:SubBuilding;Premise,DE:SubBuilding;Premise,AT:SubBuilding;Premise or ReturnVerifiedFieldsOnly=US,CA,GB. The former will return verified fields only in Belgium, Germany, and Austria, but will retain non-verified data in the Premise and SubBuilding fields, the latter will return verified fields only in USA, Canada, UK. |
| SearchAutocompleteIndexCheck     | Specifies whether or not to use the ‘autocomplete index’ algorithm integral to Address Powersearch (this will not function if Address Powersearch is not installed). This algorithm returns a list of suggestions in record time for entries like ‘4916 eas’ in the US. For more information on Address Powersearch, [please visit](/available-processes/search-process/). Related to this option is the AutocompleteIndexOnly option which will prevent other algorithms from being called. Because the autocomplete index algorithm is much faster than the other algorithms, this guarantees a faster response time in all situations. Default Yes.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| SearchLikeFieldCheck             | Specifies whether or not to use the ‘like field’ algorithm. This option looks for an exact field match in the address field which is useful for single items like postcodes, building names, organization names, etc. Default Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| SearchMatchRules                 | A list of default match rules specifying how fields can be combined when attempting to generate a search. This can be overridden on a per-country basis, and should only be changed if requested by Support staff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| SearchReferenceTypes             | Specifies the list of lexicon tagged field types that should be searched for in the reference data during a parse process. This should only be changed if requested by Support staff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| SimpleParse                      | Specifies whether or not to use the ‘simple parse’ algorithm. This option looks for something like premise + street in the address field, but is not particularly tolerant of invalid input data. Default Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| StrictReferenceMatch             | This option helps to output results that are identical to what is found within the reference data. For example, if an input address has a premise of “08”, but the reference data contains “8”, the Premise would be verified with an Premise Number output of ”08”. Turning on StrictReferenceMatch would have the output be “8”. Default No.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
