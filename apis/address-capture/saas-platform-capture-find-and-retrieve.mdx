sidebarTitle: "Saas Platform Capture Find And Retrieve"
---

Address Capture consists of two main API requests: a Find request is used to narrow down a possible list of addresses; and a Retrieve request is used to retrieve a fully formatted address.

A typical address search is made up of a series of Find requests, fired on user input, followed by a Retrieve based on the user selection.

<Warning>
  Please note that the Saas Platform is currently only available in North
  America.
</Warning>

## Base URL

All API requests use the same base URL of:

```
https://api-us.platform.loqate.com
```

<Note>
  Note:we don't support API connections using HTTP - all calls should use HTTPS.
</Note>

## Authentication

API requests are authenticated using your API key as the value of a `key` parameter on the request.

An authenticated sample request would therefore look like this:

```
https://api-us.platform.loqate.com/address-capture/find?text=GBG PLC&key=[insert your key here]
```

## Find (GET)

### Base URL

| IsMiddleware | Optional | boolean | Whether the API is being called from a middleware implementation (and therefore the calling IP address should not be used for biasing).                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Origin       | Optional | string  | A starting location for the search. This can be the name or ISO 2 or 3 character code of a country, WGS84 coordinates (comma separated) or IP address to search from.                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Bias         | Optional | boolean | When Bias is set to True and when the Origin value provided is WGS84 coordinates or an IP address, this allows the user to find addresses that are near to them with less entry. When Bias is set to False, information provided in the Origin field will be used to prefer address matches from the country that Origin field identifies. |
| Filters      | Optional | string  | You can include or exclude certain type of addresses or locations from the address matches presented back to end user. All Filters are currently operating on the basis of an exact match. Multiple Filters can be provided in the same request.                                                                                           |
