Address Capture consists of two main API requests: a Find request is used to
narrow down a possible list of addresses; and a Retrieve request is used to
retrieve a fully formatted address.

A typical address search is made up of a series of Find requests, followed by a
Retrieve based on the user selection. Choose a service below to find out how to
use each request.

#### Capture Interactive Find (v1.1)

Uses a text search to find addresses and places. Note this does not return
formatted addresses, and repeated calls to this service may be required to
drill-down through results until an address ID is returned. The address ID
should then be passed into the Retrieve service to obtain a fully formatted
address.

#### Capture Interactive Retrieve (v1.2)

Returns the full address details based on the Id.

#### Capture Interactive GeoLocation (v1)

A valuable optional add-on for Capture customers, this Reverse
GeoLocationservice takes a latitude longitude point and returns addresses that
are within a specified radius. This must be followed by a Retrieve to obtain a
fully formatted address.
