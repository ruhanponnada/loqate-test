Uses a text search to find addresses and places. Note this does not return formatted addresses, and repeated calls to this service may be required to drill-down through results until an address ID is returned. The address ID should then be passed into the Retrieve service to obtain a fully formatted address.

This method does not consume credit.

## Filters

You can include or exclude certain type of addresses or locations from the address matches presented back to the end user. All Filters are currently operating on the basis of an exact match. Multiple filters can be provided in the same request.

`&Filters=<Fieldname>:<Text>` - this is an IS filter and will limit matches to the subset where this field value is as specified

`&Filters=!<Fieldname>:<Text>` - this is an ISN'T filter and will exclude any matches where this field value is as specified

<hr />
## Example This will return matches that are in Nottingham, UK and exclude
addresses with NG11 7EP postcode:

&Filters=Locality:Nottingham&Filters=!Postcode:NG11 7EP

<hr />

The following filters are supported:
