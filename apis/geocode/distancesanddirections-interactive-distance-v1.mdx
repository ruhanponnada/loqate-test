## Request parameters

Each request to the web service requires a number of parameters, all of which are listed below. All requests require a key which can be generated in your account.

<Note>
  Note: where potentially sensitive data is used in these parameters, remember
  to make the request as secure as possible.

| Key\*        | String |                                       | The key to use to authenticate to the service.                                                                   |
| Start\*      | String |                                       | The coordinates (latitude, longitude or easting, northing) of the start of the route. A postcode is also valid.  |
| Finish\*     | String |                                       | The coordinates (latitude, longitude or easting, northing) of the finish of the route. A postcode is also valid. |
| WayPoints    | String |                                       | The coordinates (latitude, longitude or easting, northing) of any waypoints. Postcodes are also valid.           |
| DistanceType | String | Fastest<br/>Shortest<br/>StraightLine | Specifies how the distances between the stores are calculated.                                                   |

## Response

The response from the web service is a table with the specification below. Where no items are found, the response will be empty (although all endpoints specify the columns). If an error occurs, the response will not follow this format. Instead the response will be an error table.

| Name          | Type    | Example | Description                                     |
| ------------- | ------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| SegmentNumber | Integer | 0       | A zero based counter indicating the row number. |
| TotalTime     | Integer | 1080    | The total time in seconds for the route.        |
| TotalDistance | Integer | 16298   | The total distance in metres for the route.     |

## Errors

Below are the errors which are specific to this web service. If an error occurs, an error table like the one below will be returned. To check for an error response, test for a 4 column table with columns "Error", "Description", "Cause" and "Resolution" containing a single row.

For a list of errors applicable to all APIs, have a look at the list of common errors.

| Id   | Error                         | Cause                                                                                                                                                                                | Resolution                                                        |
