The following errors are common across our APIs. More specific errors can be
found in each API page.

If an error occurs, an error table like the one below (but containing a single
row) will be returned. To test for an error response, look for a 4-column table
with columns `Error`, `Description`, `Cause` and `Resolution`.

Generic errors like these have IDs below 100. Specific errors have IDs starting
at 1000.
