The Bulk Email Validation API allows you to submit requests containing up to
100,000 emails to be validated. This process happens asynchronously, allowing
you to submit a job and retrieve it later once it has finished processing.

The service will inform you whether the emails addresses are valid or invalid,
and provide additional information to offer further clarity. For a full list of
statuses that can be returned and their implications, please see the tables
later on in this guide.

Please note that this service is hosted in the United States.

In this guide we will:

- Explain how to make requests to the Bulk Email Validation API using three
  endpoints:
  - **Submit:** first, submit a list of emails for validation
  - **Status:** next, check the status of your submission
  - **Retrieve:** lastly, retrieve the results of your validation
- Provide a list of possible errors
- Offer best practice advice to help you make the most of this API

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have a Loqate account. If you don't already
have one, you will need to
[sign up here](https://account.loqate.com/Register/).

**You will also need a valid API key for use with the Bulk Email Validation
service. We recommend you create a new API key, rather than repurposing an
existing Email Validation key.**

Use the instructions in
[this Quick Setup Guide](/guides/address-email-and-phone-verification/quick-setup-guide/) to create a new Email Validation key:

- Follow the steps under the **Adding the Loqate Tag to your site** and **Email
  Validation** sections.
- You can use the Settings options to customise your key if you want, but none
  of those options should be necessary.

### Best Practice and Guidance

Follow these guidelines to ensure your submissions are processed quickly and
efficiently:

- Please limit the number of emails you submit per job to 100,000 or less (if
  you include more than this limit you will get an error)
- We recommend organising your lists so that you have a small number of large
  lists rather than lots of smaller lists
  - It is more beneficial to combine lists locally and submit as a single job
    rather than submitting each chunk of data separately
- We also recommend uploading one list at a time as uploading multiple lists
  will impact your processing speed. It is generally best to wait for one job to
  finish before uploading another
- If your list contains duplicates, each will be counted as an individual
  validation

Some other things to consider before making any submissions:

- Your account will be charged when you submit a job to us. If there are any
  issues in the processing of your job, we will credit back to your account
  where applicable
- Jobs will be stored for retrieval for up to 7 days before being deleted from
  our system. Please make sure you retrieve them within this time period, or you
  risk losing your results
- Keep your API key(s) safe. We suggest using separate API key(s) for this
  service and not to hardcode them into front end code where they can be scraped
  by a bad actor

### Submitting a request

Start the process by submitting your list of emails in a JSON format, using a
POST request to the **Submit** endpoint.

We have included example requests for all three endpoints, which you can use by
swapping out the placeholders for your own API key and a selection of email
addresses. We recommend you include at least one valid email address and at
least one **invalid **email address, so that you can see the different statuses
when using the Retrieve endpoint.

Note: we don't support API connections using HTTP - all calls should use HTTPS.

Example request:

`POST <https://api.addressy.com/EmailValidation/Bulk/Submit/v1.00/json4.ws>`

Header: Content-Type=application/json

```json
{
  "key": "Key",
  "emails": ["validemail@example.com", "invalidemail@example.com"]
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "ListId": "46361a42-55fe-4983-8c29-489297e40033",
  "ListState": "Pending"
}
```

Please keep note of the **ListID** generated in the response, as this will be
needed for all calls to the Status and Retrieve endpoints.

### Checking the status of a job

Once your job has been uploaded and you have your **listID**, you are then able
to check the status of your job by making a GET request to
the **Status** endpoint.

Example request:

```
GET
https://api.addressy.com/EmailValidation/Bulk/Status/v1.00/json4.ws?key=\<key\>&listid=\<list-id\>
```

```json
{
  "Key": "Key",
  "ListID": "ListID"
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "ListID": "46361a42-55fe-4983-8c29-489297e40033",
  "ListState": "Complete",
  "TotalVerifiedEmails": 2
}
```

<Note>
  Note that **TotalVerifiedEmails** shows the number of emails which have been
  verified so far, providing an indicator of the current status of your request
  (this updates every minute). This doesn\'t reflect the number that will be
  returned as **valid** in the Retrieve response.
</Note>

Please see the following table for potential list states and their meaning. This
endpoint should be polled until it returns a **Complete** ListState.

#### List States

Here are the list states you can receive when polling the status endpoint:

| List State | Description                                                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pending    | Job has been submitted but not started yet                                            |
| Verifying  | Job is in progress                                                                    |
| Complete   | Job has been completed and is ready for retrieval                                     |
| Failed     | Job has failed due to an error. Credit will be applied to your account where relevant |

\

### Retrieving your results

Once a **Complete **ListState has been returned, your job is ready for retrieval
by making a GET request to the **Retrieve** endpoint.

Example request:

```
GET:
https://api.addressy.com/EmailValidation/Bulk/Retrieve/v1.00/json4.ws?key=\<key\>&listid=\<list-id\>
```

```json
{
  "Key": "Key",
  "ListID": "ListID"
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "ListId": "46361a42-55fe-4983-8c29-489297e40033",
  "ListState": "Complete",
"TotalEmailCount": 2,
"Results": [
  {
      "Email": "validemail@example.com",
      "Status": "valid",
      "StatusMessage": "role_address"
      "Account": "validemail",
      "Domain": "example.com"
  },
      {
      "Email": "invalidemail@example.com",
      "Status": "invalid",
      "StatusMessage": "email_domain_invalid"
      "Account": "validemail",
      "Domain": "example.com"
     }
]
}
```

#### Result Fields

Your result for each email will be made up of the below fields.

| Field         | Description                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Email         | The email address you have sent to us for validation                                                                      |
| Status        | The status of the validation. Please see the below section for further information on possible statuses                   |

#### Statuses

The results of your job will return a Primary Status (**Status**) and a
Secondary Status (**StatusMessage**) per email. The following tables show the
various potential statuses that might be returned.

##### Primary Status

| Status     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| valid      | Email address is a valid account                                                                                                                                                                  |
| invalid    | Email address is invalid, refer to secondary statuses below for more information                                                                                                                  |
| accept_all | Indicates that the domain always says their emails are valid, even if they are not. This may be due to a firewall or another spam tool that can remove the message or send a bounce message later |
| unknown    | The email address looks valid, but the domain is not responding. This could be a temporary issue if the domain is having problems, a dead domain, or due to a company firewall blocking access    |

##### Status Message

By default the StatusMessage will return as a blank field unless there is
additional information to display.

| StatusMessage         | Description                                                                                                                                                              |

| role_address          | The email address was created to support a function such as support@, sales@ etc. This may be a valid email but typically underperforms compared to individual addresses |

### Errors

The table below lists the errors which exist for each of the API endpoints
above.
