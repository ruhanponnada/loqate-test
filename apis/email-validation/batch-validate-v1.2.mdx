| Name     | Type   | Values | Description                                                                                                     |
| -------- | ------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Key\*    | String |        | The key to use to authenticate to the service.                                                                  |

Response
The response from the web service is a table with the specification below. Where no items are found, the response will be empty (although all endpoints specify the columns). If an error occurs, the response will not follow this format. Instead the response will be an [error table](/apis/email-validation/batch-validate-v1.2/).

| Name            | Type    | Example             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Status          | String  | Valid               | Valid - The email address is valid Invalid - The email address is invalid and shouldn't be accepted Unknown - Unable to complete the verification process (normally due to SMTP timeout) Accept_All - The mail server is set to accept all verification requests so full verification isn't possible |
| EmailAddress    | String  | testing@test123.com | The email address that verification was attempted on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Errors

Below are the errors which are specific to this web service. If an error occurs, an error table like the one below will be returned. To check for an error response, test for a 4 column table with columns "Error", "Description", "Cause" and "Resolution" containing a single row.

For a list of errors applicable to all APIs, have a look at the [list of common errors](/apis/generic-errors/).

| Id   | Error                       | Cause                                                              | Resolution                                                               |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1001 | Emails Required             | No email addresses were supplied.                                  | Check that you have between 1 and 100 emails in the batch and try again. |
| 1002 | Invalid Batch Size          | No more than 100 emails should be supplied in the batch.           | Check that you have less than 100 emails in the batch and try again.     |
| 1003 | Invalid Email List Provided | You have entered one of more semi-colon or colon separated emails. | Ensure that all emails are comma separated and try the request again.    |
