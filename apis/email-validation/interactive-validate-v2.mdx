### Response

The response from the web service is a table with the specification below. Where no items are found, the response will be empty (although all endpoints specify the columns). If an error occurs, the response will not follow this format. Instead the response will be an error table.

| Name                    | Type    | Example             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ResponseCode            | String  | Valid               | Valid - The email address has been fully validated (including the account portion) Valid_CatchAll - The domain has been validated but the account could not be validated Invalid - The email address is invalid and shouldn't be accepted Timeout - The validation could not be completed within the timeout specified (try increasing the timeout value) |
| ResponseMessage         | String  | Valid               | A textual description of the ResponseCode returned                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Domain                  | String  | test123.com         | The domain portion of the email address provided.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| IsDisposableOrTemporary | Boolean | False               | Whether the email address provided is a disposable mailbox (some companies create temporary mailboxes which shouldn't be used for marketing communications).                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| IsComplainerOrFraudRisk | Boolean | False               | This field is no longer valid and will always return False                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Duration                | Float   | 0.526               | The duration (in seconds) that the email validation took (maximum timeout enforced at 15 seconds). We recommend a high timeout (at least 5 seconds) value as it will minimise the number of "Timeout" responses returned.                                                                                                                                 |
| Reason                  | String  | Fault Reason        | The Reason the email wasnt valid                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Risk                    | String  | High                | High, Medium, Low or Unknown. This score is an aggregated analysis of all the email fields returned and gives an indication of whether mail should be sent to that address. Higher risk indicates a greater likelihood that the email will bounce.                                                                                                        |
