The Global Geocoding API takes an input of one or more address strings and
returns latitude and longitudes for the given locations. It can also be used for
reverse geocoding, returning addresses that are close to a given set of latitude
and longitude co-ordinates.

When reverse geocoding, multiple addresses will be returned if possible (with a
maximum of 5). This is because, particularly in urban areas, it can be difficult
to identify the specific property associated with a set of co-ordinates.

title="A note on multiple inputs"
>

Please note that whilst the API can accept an input of multiple
addresses/co-ordinates, response times will be quicker if only one is sent at a
time.

For the UK, only the first address/co-ordinate in the string will be parsed
(i.e. only one geocoding/reverse geocoding result will be provided).

If sending multiple addresses/co-ordinates, limiting these to one country will
also improve performance.

The Global Geocoding API supports
most international locations. For a full list of coverage please
see [here](/data-coverage/introduction/).

**This method will consume credit. You will be charged per address geocoded.**

```

<Note>
  Note: we don't support API connections using HTTP - all calls should use
  HTTPS.
</Note>

### Request

Each request to the web service requires a number of parameters, all of which
are listed below. All requests require a key which can be generated
in [your account](https://account.loqate.com/account/#/Setup/).

<Note>
  **Note: where potentially sensitive data is used in these parameters, remember
  to make the request as secure as possible.**
</Note>

#### Request parameters

| --------- | -------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Key       | Required | String           | The key used to authenticate with the service. For example: "AA11-AA11-AA11-AA11".                                                                                                                          |
| Input     | Required | Array of Strings | An array of strings containing either location co-ordinates and/or unstructured addresses. This array can contain up to 10 items.                                                                           |
| Country   | Optional | String           | The ISO2 or ISO3 country code (e.g. GB or GBR). This will limit the geocoding lookup to the specified country, but will improve performance. This parameter is not required for reverse geocoding requests. |

| GeoAccuracy        | String | This field is made up of the geocoding status and geocoding level. For more information on this please see the section below. When looking for a geocoding result it's important to look for this field, as if we return U0 it means we have been unable to geocode that input.          |
| LocationType       | String | This field identifies the level we have validated a given address or co-ordinates to. E.g. if we cannot identify a premise number we may only validate to Thoroughfare level.                                                                                                            |

#### GeoAccuracy Description

The GeoAccuracy code is made up of the following values:

- The geocoding Status
- The geocoding Level

e.g. I4, A2, P4

**Geocoding Status**

- *P: Point* - a single geocode was found matching the input address
- *I: Interpolated* - a geocode was able to be interpolated from the input
  addresses location in a range
- *A: Average* - multiple candidate geocodes were found to match the input
  address, and an average of these was returned
- *U: Unable to geocode* - a geocode was not able to be generated for the input
  address

**Geocoding Level**

- 4: Premise (Premise or Building)
- 3: Thoroughfare
- 2: Locality
- 1: AdministrativeArea
- 0: None :

## Errors

Below are the errors which are specific to this web service. If an error occurs,
an error table like the one below will be returned. To check for an error
response, test for a 4-column table with columns `Error`, `Description`,
`Cause` and `Resolution` containing a single row.

Here's a generic example, for reference:

```json
{
  "Items": [
    {
      "Error": "2",
      "Description": "Unknown key",
      "Cause": "The key you are using to access the service was not found.",
      "Resolution": "Please check that the key is correct. It should be in the form AA11-AA11-AA11-AA11."
    }
  ]
}
```

For a list of errors applicable to all APIs, have a look at the
[list of common errors](/apis/generic-errors/).
