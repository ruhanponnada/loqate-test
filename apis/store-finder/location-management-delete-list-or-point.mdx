sidebarTitle: "Location Management Delete List Or Point"
---

Delete a list of locations or a particular location within that list.

<Warning>
  This endpoint requires the use of a Loqate **Management** key. Management keys
  are used to provide access to server-side functions in place of your standard
  API key, ensuring that were any of your keys to be scraped from a customer
  facing website, they could not be used to edit or delete your Location Lists.
  For information on how to create a Management key please see the [Setting Up
  Store Finder Keys guide](/guides/store-finder/setting-up-store-finder-keys/).
</Warning>

The Delete List or Point API allows you to delete an existing list created using
our
[Create List endpoint](/apis/store-finder/location-management-create-list/).

<Note>
  **NOTE: any lists deleted via this endpoint are deleted permanently. We do not
  back up location lists.**

### Request

Each request to the web service requires a number of parameters, all of which
are listed below. All requests require a key which can be generated
in [your account](https://account.loqate.com/account/#/Setup/).

<Note>
  **Note: where potentially sensitive data is used in these parameters, remember
  to make the request as secure as possible.**
</Note>

A listID or locationID is a required parameter for this operation. If you want
to delete an entire list, only a listID is required. If you want to delete a
location, both a listID and locationID are required.

### Response

The response from the web service is a table with the specification below. Where
no items are found, the response will be empty (although all endpoints specify
the columns). If an error occurs, the response will not follow this format.
Instead the response will be an [error table](#errors).

#### Response fields

| ------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| message | String | A message detailing how the operation performed. |
| Id      | String | The GuID of the list or location deleted.        |

#### Example Delete List response

```json
{
  "message": "List deleted successfully",
  "id": "7bbcbea3-c995-4ed7-9be2-bfb25b3b2cef"
}
```

#### Example Delete Location response

```json
{
    "message": "Location deleted successfully",
    "id": "443d67b0-0c81-4ba9-9e1b-21435db6ee1e
}
```

### Errors

Below are the errors which are specific to this web service. If an error occurs,
an error table like the one below will be returned. To check for an error
response, test for a 4-column table with columns `Number`, `Description`,
`Cause` and `Resolution` containing a single row.

Here's an example, for reference:

```json
{
  "Number": 1010,
  "Description": "Location Management operations required a Management Key",
  "Cause": "Location Management operations required a Management Key",
  "Resolution": "Ensure you are using a Management key created by adding a Store Finder service to your Loqate account"
}
```

For a list of errors applicable to all APIs, have a look at the
[list of common errors](/apis/generic-errors/).
