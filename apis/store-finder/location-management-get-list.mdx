#### Request

Each request to the web service requires a number of parameters, all of which are listed below. All requests require a key which can be generated in your account.

  to make the request as secure as possible.

### Request parameters

| Parameter | Required | Type   | Description                                                                        |
| --------- | -------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Key       | Required | String | The key used to authenticate with the service. For example: `AA11-AA11-AA11-AA11`. |
| listID    | Optional | String | The unique GuID for a given list.                                                  |

When sending a request, if a listID is provided then the response will contain all of the points within that list. If no ListID is provided, the response will contain a list of the location lists associated with your account.

### Example request

Add your API key into the code below for a sample request:

```
GET https://api.addressy.com/LocationServices/LocationManagement/GetLists/v1.00/json4.ws?&key=AA11-AA11-AA11-AA11&listId=f0a0d848-1ffb-43e2-bf98-3025ca274832
```

Content-Type: application/json

### Response

The response from the web service is a table with the specification below. Where no items are found, the response will be empty (although all endpoints specify the columns). If an error occurs, the response will not follow this format. Instead the response will be an error table.

### Errors

Below are the errors which are specific to this web service. If an error occurs, an error table like the one below will be returned. To check for an error response, test for a 4-column table with columns "Number", "Description", "Cause" and "Resolution" containing a single row.

Here's an example, for reference:

```json
{
  "Number": 1006,
  "Description": "No list of that ID can be found associated with your account.",
  "Cause": "There has either been no list uploaded with that ID or one that has had that ID previously has been deleted.",
  "Resolution": "Correct ListID and try again."
}
```

For a list of errors applicable to all APIs, have a look at the [list of common errors](/apis/generic-errors/).
