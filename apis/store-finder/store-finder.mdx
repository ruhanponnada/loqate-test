#### Geocoding Typeahead

The Geocoding Typeahead API uses a text search to suggest Town, City, State and
Postcode/ZIP Codes. When one of these is selected by the end user, a subsequent
request (using the associated address ID) can be made to retrieve the latitude
and longitude for the location.

#### Global Geocoding

The Global Geocoding API takes an input of one or more address strings and
returns latitude and longitudes for the given locations. It can also be used for
reverse geocoding, returning addresses that are close to a given set of latitude
and longitude co-ordinates.
