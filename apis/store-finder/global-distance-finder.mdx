The Global Distance Finder API takes an input of an origin location and one or more destination locations, and returns road-based distance and travel times for each of them. When crossing bodies of water, ferry transport will be taken into consideration where data is available.

Please note that there are no limits to how many points you can send us, however your results returned will be limited to the nearest 100 points within a maximum of a 500km radius. In general there is a linear correlation between number of points/distance and response times. Due to this we recommend limiting to the fewest points possible for your application.

Travel times are calculated using historical traffic data.

This API supports most international locations. Distance calculation is supported between countries (e.g. France to Germany) provided that those countries are within the same region (e.g. Europe, Africa, Asia).

**This method will consume credit. It is charged per request regardless of the number of destinations.**

### Request

Each request to the web service requires a number of parameters, all of which are listed below. All requests require a key which can be generated in your account.

<Note>
  Note: where potentially sensitive data is used in these parameters, remember
  to make the request as secure as possible.

| Parameter      | Required | Type             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Key            | Required | String           | The key used to authenticate with the service. For example: `AA11-AA11-AA11-AA11`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| locationListID | Optional | String           | A GuID that identifies a list previously created using our Create List API. When this field is populated with a valid ID, the API will utilise the list for your destination locations.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| locations      | Optional | Array of Strings | An array of strings that is populated with information about a location. Any points in the locations object will be used to calculate distances from your origin location. If not using a previously uploaded Location List then at least one location must be sent in the request.                                                                     |
| originLocation | Required | Array of Strings | An array of strings that is populated with information about your origin location. This will be the starting point for all distances calculated via the API.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| maxDistance    | Optional | Integer          | The maximum straight line distance radius of results that will be returned, starting from the original location, in metres. For example, setting a maxDistance of 100000 will only return results within a 100km radius of the origin. By default this is set to 100km with a maximum value of 500km. A smaller search radius will improve performance. |
| orderBy        | Optional | String           | The order in which you want results to be returned. By default this will return locations in ascending distance order (i.e. closest location first). Time can be passed instead, to return in order of ascending travel time.                                                                                                                           |
| maxResults     | Optional | Integer          | The maximum number of locations you want returned. By default this is set to 10 with a maximum value of 100. Reducing the number of results returned will also improve performance.                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Errors

Below are the errors which are specific to this web service. If an error occurs, an error table like the one below will be returned. To check for an error response, test for a 4-column table with columns "Error", "Description", "Cause" and "Resolution" containing a single row.

Here's a generic example, for reference:

```json
{
  "Items": [
    {
      "Error": "2",
      "Description": "Unknown key",
      "Cause": "The key you are using to access the service was not found.",
      "Resolution": "Please check that the key is correct. It should be in the form AA11-AA11-AA11-AA11."
    }
  ]
}
```
