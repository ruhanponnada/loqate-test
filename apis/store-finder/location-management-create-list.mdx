Create a list of locations that can be used with our

[Distance Finder endpoint](/apis/store-finder/global-distance-finder/).

<Warning>
  This endpoint requires the use of a Loqate **Management** key. Management keys
  are used to provide access to server-side functions in place of your standard
  API key, ensuring that were any of your keys to be scraped from a customer
  facing website, they could not be used to edit or delete your Location Lists.
  For information on how to create a Management key please see the [Setting Up
  Store Finder Keys guide](/guides/store-finder/setting-up-store-finder-keys/).
</Warning>

The Create List API allows you to create a list of locations, including their
co-ordinates and their IDs. It can also store additional information such as a
description of each location, opening times, and address, to provide more
context.

This API also supports the use of a "metaInfo" object which can be used to store
any other relevant information such as contact details, accessibility
information etc.

When uploading a list, co-ordinates for each location are mandatory. If you do
not have the co-ordinates of a location but have the address instead, we can
geocode those for you. If the geocoding option is selected we will geocode every
address in your request, any existing geocodes you send us will be overwritten.

When Geocoding a list, if a geocode cannot be found for one of your locations
then the request will fail. You will not be charged, and we will outline which
address(es) had caused the issue.

<Info>
  **Please note that each address geocoded is chargeable based on your [standard
  geocoding cost](https://www.loqate.com/en-gb/pricing/).**
</Info>

Geocoding supports most international locations. For a full list of coverage
please see [here](/data-coverage/introduction/).
