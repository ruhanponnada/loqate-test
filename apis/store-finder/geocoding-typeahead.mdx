The Geocoding Typeahead API uses a text search to suggest Town, City, State and Postcode/ZIP Codes. When one of these is selected by the end user, a subsequent request (using the associated address ID) can be made to retrieve the latitude and longitude for the location.

The Global Geocoding API currently supports an initial set of 17 countries, with more scheduled for inclusion in the near future. See the ['List of available countries' section](/#list-of-available-countries) for details of which territories are available.

Text searches using the "Input" field are always free. This method will consume credit per `addressID` search and co-ordinates returned.

## Input search

An Input search is used to take a string input and provide suggested location responses. This can be triggered after each key stroke from your end user.

Each request to the web service requires a number of parameters, all of which are listed below. All requests require a key which can be generated in your account.

<Note>
  Note: where potentially sensitive data is used in these parameters, remember
  to make the request as secure as possible.

| Input     | Required | string  | The search text to find. This can be a Town, City, State, Postcode or ZIP Code. Requests made using this as an input will be free.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Types     | Optional | string  | The types that you want to be returned in the response. Valid types are Locality \| Postcode \| AdministrativeArea. This can be set to include multiple types (comma separated). For example, passing "Postcode" will only return Postcode results; passing "Locality, Postcode" will return both Locality and Postcode. |
| Origin    | Optional | string  | A starting location for the search. This can be the name or ISO 2 or 3 character code of a country, WGS84 coordinates (comma separated) or IP address to search from.                                                                                                                                                    |

#### Example request: Input search

Add your API key into the code below for a sample Input search request:

```
GET https://api.addressy.com/LocationServices/Geocoding/GlobalTypeAhead/v1.00/json4.ws?key=AA11-AA11-AA11-AA11&input=Worcester&countries=GB&origin=145.119.1.237&&
```

Content-Type: application/json

The response from the web service is a table with the specification below. Where no items are found, the response will be empty (although all endpoints specify the columns). If an error occurs, the response will not follow this format. Instead the response will be an error table.

#### Response fields: Input search

| Description | string | The second half of the location that's displayed to the user, featuring the broader geographic area. For example, if the returned location is "Worcester, Worcestershire" then Description will display "Worcestershire" as this is the larger geographic area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Highlight   | string | A list of number ranges showing which characters in the Text and Description fields match the user's search term. This can be used to determine which characters should be highlighted in bold in the search field, to give the user a visual representation of what's being searched. Notes: Highlight ranges are expressed as 'X-Y' where highlighting should start from character position X and go up to but not including character position Y. Characters start from position 0. Commas separate numbers within a single field, while a semicolon separates numbers in Text from numbers in Description. Spaces are counted as characters. If no characters in Text should be highlighted, the string will start with a semicolon. Take the example "0-4, 7; 1-4" - this indicates that characters 0, 1, 2, 3 and 7 in the Text field should be highlighted, and also characters 1, 2 and 3 in the Description field. |
| Language    | string | Currently will always return blank.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

### AddressID search

An addressID search is used to take an ID returned from an Input search and provide co-ordinates and additional location details in its response. This can be triggered after the user selects a suggested location.

Each request to the web service requires a number of parameters, all of which are listed below. All requests require a key which can be generated in [your account](https://account.loqate.com/account/#/Setup/).

<Note>
  Note: where potentially sensitive data is used in these parameters, remember
  to make the request as secure as possible.
</Note>

| addressID | Yes      | string | The unique identifier for a location, as provided in a previous Input search. For example: `VE_CiVlgwok_QT1BPT4_QT1FP0U-PT5Dwok_QD0`. Requests made with this parameter will return co-ordinates and be charged. |

#### Example request: addressID search

Add your API key into the code below for a sample addressID search request:

```
GET https://api.addressy.com/LocationServices/Geocoding/GlobalTypeAhead/v1.00/json4.ws?addressId=VE_CiVlgwok_QT1BPT4_QT1FP0U-PT5Dwok_QD0&key=AA11-AA11-AA11-AA11
```

Content-Type: application/json

The response from the web service is a table with the specification below. Where no items are found, the response will be empty (although all endpoints specify the columns). If an error occurs, the response will not follow this format. Instead the response will be an error table.
