Update a list of locations or a particular location within that list. Lists modified using this API can be used with our Distance Finder endpoint.

<Warning>
  This endpoint requires the use of a Loqate **Management** key. Management keys
  are used to provide access to server-side functions in place of your standard
  API key, ensuring that were any of your keys to be scraped from a customer
  facing website, they could not be used to edit or delete your Location Lists.
  For information on how to create a Management key please see the [Setting Up
  Store Finder Keys guide](/guides/store-finder/setting-up-store-finder-keys/).
</Warning>

The Update List or Point API allows you to update an existing list created using our Create List endpoint.

When updating a list or point, any fields left null will retain their original information.

To add new points to a list, only supply the new values - the existing points will be unaffected. You can add a maximum of 100 points to an existing list per request.
