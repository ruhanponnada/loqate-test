title: "Consuming Premium Data Sets"
---

There are a series of extra datasets available via our address capture services.
As these datasets are covered by separate terms and agreements they will need to
be activated on your account for you, please get in touch if you are interested
in taking advantage of any of our premium datasets.

There are a few approaches you can take in consuming these extra datasets, and
which one is appropriate depends on how you want to integrate with the service.

### Direct Via the API

#### Find

Your extra dataset can be activated by us as a setting on the key itself. This
means that the selected API key will always return data from the selected
dataset. Alternatively, you can use any API key from your account and specify
the dataset required via a parameter on the request.

Note: If a premium dataset is requested using an API key from an account that
does not have that dataset enabled, the request will fail.

If the dataset has not been enabled on the key itself, you will need to add the
datasets parameter to the find request. The following example requests the
Business dataset be used for this find request:

```txt
https://api.addressy.com/Capture/Interactive/Find/v1.00/csv.ws?Key=AA11-AA11-AA11-AA11&Text=wr5 3da&Datasets=gb_db
```

The find request will then continue as normal using the Business data as its
dataset. Once the user selects an address from the list you will pass the Id of
that address into the retrieve request as per a normal flow.

#### Retrieve

Each premium dataset contains certain extra fields that are available in
addition to the standard fields provided by a retrieve request. By default, if
you use an Id from a premium dataset find request, the retrieve will still only
return the standard set of fields. In order to retrieve these special fields,
you will need to supply field format strings for them into the FieldFormat
Parameters of a retrieve request. These fields are in the style of FieldXFormat,
with X being the number of that field. The requested field will then be returned
in the corresponding response field, FieldX.

A normal field format will be in the style of \{FIELDNAME}.

For example, in order to retrieve the Company number from the Business dataset
you would use the following request:

```txt
https://api.addressy.com/Capture/Interactive/Retrieve/v1.00/csv.ws?Key=AA11-AA11-AA11-AA11&Id=IDFROMFIND&Field1Format={CompanyNumber}
```

This would return the the Company number in the returned property Field1.

The retrieve request is limited to 20 Field Format fields by default. Should you
require more fields than this you will need to specify a fields property along
with your field formats that will set the number of extra fields to respond
with, for example:

```txt
https://api.addressy.com/Capture/Interactive/Retrieve/v1.00/csv.ws?Key=AA11-AA11-AA11-AA11&Id=IDFROMFIND&Field1Format={CompanyNumber}......................&Field21Format={TelephoneNumber}&Fields=21
```

### Using the JavaScript SDK

If you are using our JavaScript SDK to make requests to the service, as outlined
in our
[advanced guide](/guides/address-email-and-phone-verification/advanced-setup-guide),
you can enable premium datasets via the options object used in the construction
of the control object, e.g.:

```javascript
var options = {
  key: "AA11-AA11-AA11",
  search: {
    datasets: ["gb_db"],
  },
  advancedFields: ["{CompanyNumber}"],
};
```

The same restrictions apply to the datasets as apply when directly integrating
via API.

### Using the simple setup

If you are using our simple setup wizard to install your lookup control you can
specify the field formats directly in the field mapping control using the field
format syntax, \{FIELDFORMAT}.
