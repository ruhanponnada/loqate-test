[View Release Notes](#Release-Notes)

This user guide provides information on the Property Intelligence database,
prepared by GBG for customers looking to use the data. Property Intelligence is
designed to assist in the process of providing insurance quotes for customers in
England, Wales and Scotland by supplying data on residential properties.
Property coverage:

- Houses, bungalows and flats covered although the majority of testing has been
  on freehold properties i.e. typically houses and bungalows;

Geographic coverage:

- England and Wales full coverage;
- Scotland full coverage but reduced accuracy because of different policies for
  land and property registration and the publication of data;
- Northern Ireland limited coverage, just includes estate agent data;
- Isle of Man and Channel Islands not covered;

Property Intelligence is currently built on a quarterly basis, this is subject
to review. The underlying datasets have a range of update frequencies from
monthly upwards. Updates are included in the build as they become available.

### Data items

The feature fields in the database are arranged in sets of three:

- X - this is the data item of interest, for example a number of bedrooms for
  which X = “bedrooms”;
- source_X - this is the source of the information, for example the number 2
  indicates that this data item is sourced from the Land Registry;
- p_X - this is a confidence score for the data ranging between 0 and 1.
  Confidence scores are calculated, where possible, as a “fraction correct”
  measure against a groundtruth dataset of 36,000 properties supplied by Simple
  and Open;

**Table 23: Percentage of data supplied from direct sources rather than
modelled**

## 8. Data recency

Data recency for the Property Intelligence dataset is determined by a number of
factors, listed below:

- The build process for Property Intelligence takes approximately 2 months from
  start to delivery to customer with quarterly scheduled releases;
- Individual datasets have a range of update frequencies, some are static and
  will never be updated, others are yearly, quarterly or monthly;
- Two datasets, EPC (formerly DCLG) and Estate agent data, have property-level
  fields which indicate when an inspection was carried out so potentially
  day-level data on recency could be provided;
- The LIDAR data is a composite dataset, 80% of which has been collected in the
  last 10 years;

The table below shows the dates of the datasets used in this version of Property
Intelligence along with an indication of the expected update frequency.

\
Our supplier of business information which is used to populate the
business_usage field has changed.

#### January 2022

No new fields have been added in this release but sources have been updated.\
\
Floor areas for flats are now included in modelling so that values for
neighbouring flats are used if direct data is not available.\
\
As a result of changing our address cleanser to the standard GBG Loqate Verify
engine we now include some data from Northern Ireland.

#### October 2021

No new fields have been added in this release but sources have been updated.\
\
We have added the DCLG Scotland data which provides a significant improvement in
accuracy for property type, and property age in Scotland as well as improvements
in accuracy to numbers of bedrooms and floors. DCLG Scotland also provides
fields including extension count, wall type, main fuel, floor area, total rooms,
tenure and energy rating which were not previously populated for Scotland.\
\
There are improvements in the flat floor modeller such that it does not return
unreasonable large values (over 90 storeys) or non-numeric values (other than
N/A), and floor areas for flats are now included in modelling so that values for
neighbouring flats are used if direct data is not available.\
\
As a result of changing our address cleanser to the standard GBG Loqate Verify
engine we now include some data from Northern Ireland.

#### July 2021

No new fields have been added in this release but sources have been updated.\
\
We have introduced modelling for 'flat_floor' - the storey a flat sits on which
improves the coverage for this field, and introduces new entries to the data
sources table.

#### April 2021

Tenure and energy rating fields have been added. Tenure is a replacement for the
previously removed tenancy field. It indicates whether a property is
owner-occupied, private rental or social housing. The name has been changed to
retain consistency with the underlying dataset\
\
The property age field has improved direct data content and accuracy as a result
of the addition of a new dataset.

#### January 2021

No new fields have been added in this release but sources have been updated.

#### October 2020

We have resumed supply of two fields which had been suspended:

- the congestion zone field from the raw TFL data rather than using a third
  party as a supplier;
- the cadastral area (building plot area) which had been suspended due to
  licensing issues. This is based on the Land Registry INSPIRE Polygons data;

The Land Registry House Price Index is available once again, and thus Estimated
Current Values will be up to date unless a sale went through during the period
in which the HPI was suspended.

### July 2020

As noted in the April 2020 Release notes we have removed the following fields
from this release:

- geocode accuracy
- red route
- tenancy
- multiplicity
- outdoor area
- building count
- adult occupants

The Land Registry UK House Price Index has been suspended as of the April 2020
release, due to be published in June because of the impact of COVID-19 which
means limited transactions are occurring on which to base the Index. The
relevant Land Registry Bulletin describing this change is
[here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/housepriceindex/march2020#measuring-the-data).This
means the estimated current value field will contain the estimated current value
at last release of the House Price Index - 1st March 2020.

#### April 2020

This build incorporates the OS AddressBase Premium property-level easting /
northing and latitude/longitude coordinates, these replace those provided by our
previous supplier. This data is supplied under evaluation terms which you have
already signed up to.\
\
These will be replaced with coordinates from derived from Ordnance Survey Open
Source data once this has been released in July 2020.\
\
As a result of recent supplier changes we are also withdrawing a number of
fields including the geocode accuracy and red route fields. The Congestion Zone
field will remain but not be populated in the next build.\
\
We will also be withdrawing the Tenancy field as a result of other supplier
licensing changes.\
\
Finally there are a number of fields which have not been populated for some time
including multiplicity, outdoor area, building count and number of adult
occupants. All of these fields are present in this build containing default
values in most cases but will be removed from the July 2020 build.

This release contains further parameters derived from LIDAR data, these include
building footprint, building volume, the average roof slope, a flat roof
fraction, the distance to the nearest tree over 10 metres high to the property
geocode and a geocode multiplicity which counts the number of geocodes within a
building. The building footprint is not listed below since it is not a new field
but has been re-calculated using LIDAR data.

#### October 2017

This release incorporates a major new dataset which has brought improved
accuracy to numbers of bedrooms, numbers of floors, property type and property
age fields as well as introducing a number of new fields, listed below. The
cadastral, outdoor area and footprint fields will be populated only with default

the building footprint in the February 2018 release.

#### June 2017

to flats included
