import { CustomNote } from "/snippets/CustomNote.mdx";

The Loqate Saas Platform currently offers two options for integrating Capture,
so you can choose which one is most suited depending on your requirements. In
this article we'll quickly explain the differences between the two options, and
direct you to the relevant documentation for whichever option you want to use.

The two integration options are:

- An SDK
- A full API

<Warning>
  Before setting up any Capture integration via the Loqate Saas Platform, make
  sure you have a Loqate account. If you don't already have one, you can [sign
  up here](https://app-us.platform.loqate.com/sign-up/).
  <br />
  **Please note that the Saas Platform is currently only available in North
  America**.
</Warning>

The first thing to do is to create a new service within the Saas Platform.
[See this article for how to do that.](/guides/address-email-and-phone-verification/saas-platform-integration-options)
Once you have at least one service, the next step is to decide which integration
option to use - SDK or API.

### Saas Platform SDK

We've created an SDK that gives you everything you need to get up and running
quickly with your Capture integration. Follow the instructions in the SDK
documentation to get everything set up, and consider customisation, optimisation
and troubleshooting options too.

  Not sure what an SDK is? In short, an SDK is a collection of tools that allows
  you to build a software application quicker than using something like a full
  API integration, by structuring things in a more standardised way. This is
  great for getting set up quickly, but you might want to consider an API
  integration if you're looking for full control over your implementation.

You can find the [SDK documentation
here](/guides/address-email-and-phone-verification/saas-platform-sdk).

Alternatively, you can access the documentation within the Saas Platform itself.
To do so, select the relevant service from within your account and then click
the SDK Integration option.

### Saas Platform API

If you want to tap into the full flexibility of Capture, use our APIs to create
your own bespoke integration.

You can find the
[API documentation (including both Find and Retrieve) here](/apis/address-capture/saas-platform-capture-find-and-retrieve).

Alternatively, you can access the documentation within the Saas Platform itself.
To do so, select the relevant service from within your account and then click
the **Setup Guide & API Key** option.
