title: "Enabling New Capture Features"
---

The latest version of Capture brings with it a number of inherent benefits, from
even better data to improved search functionality, but it also provides
additional features that you can enable if you wish. These features are:

- **Enhanced location biasing:** automatically detect users' locations to assist
  the scoring and ranking of search results, helping to find the nearest
  matching addresses without requiring a full address to be entered
- **Advanced results filtering:** restrict the results that are returned by
  Capture based on custom parameters that you can choose

These new features are all optional, and you can choose to enable one, some or
all of them. Please note that if you do enable any of these new features, they
will apply to **all** Capture searches.

## Setup

All of these new features can be switched on or off in
[your Loqate account](https://account.loqate.com/). Here are the steps to follow
to begin with:

- Log into your account
- Choose the service you want to edit (this will usually be listed as 'Address
  Verification')
- Navigate to the Advanced tab

Follow the further steps below for each of the features you want to turn on.

### Location Biasing

Enabling the Location Biasing feature results in reduced keystrokes and a
quicker address entry process for your customers.

Enabling the biasing feature is just a case of toggling th&#x65;**&#x20;Location
Biasing** switch to **On**.

### Advanced Results Filtering

The Filters feature allows you to set up one or more filters to restrict the
results of your searches - i.e. to choose whether you want your searches to
include or exclude certain things.

There are three components to each filter:

- **Filter name:** choose what you want to filter by - see the list below for
  details of each of the possible options
- **Qualifier:** choose **is** or **is not** to set whether you want to include
  or exclude results
- **Filter value:** set the specific value you want to include or exclude

For each filter you want to set up, fill in these three components and click the
**Add** button. You can create multiple filters, depending on what you want to
achieve.

<Note>
  Note that if you include more than one filter, search results will need to
  fulfil both/all filters before being included.
</Note>
Here is an example where two filters have been set up to allow for a search of
addresses in the city of Worcester, excluding any addresses registered to Loqate
(i.e. if you wanted to search a specific area but exclude one or more
organisations):

Here are the full details of the different filters available (note that some are
only available with US and CA data):
