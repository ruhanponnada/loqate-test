### Quickstart

The following example will import our css and js files and initialise an
instance of the address lookup control.

<CustomInfo image="/images/ed6f099c-tool.svg" imageSize="50px">
  You will need to use references to your own fields in order to tell the
  control where to bind to.
</CustomInfo>

```javascript
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://assets.loqate.com/capture-sdk/v0/capture-sdk.css" />
<script type="module">
  import { Capture, FieldMode } from "https://assets.loqate.com/capture-sdk/v0/capture-sdk.js";
  let fields = [
    { element: "#search", field: "" },
    { element: "#company", field: "company", mode: FieldMode.DEFAULT | FieldMode.PRESERVE },
    { element: "#line1", field: "line1" },
    { element: "#line2", field: "line2", mode: FieldMode.POPULATE },
    { element: "#city", field: "city", mode: FieldMode.POPULATE },
    { element: "#state", field: "province", mode: FieldMode.POPULATE },
    { element: "#postcode", field: "postalCode" },
    { element: "#country", field: "countryName", mode: FieldMode.COUNTRY }
  ];
  let capture = new Capture(fields, {
    key: "bafe2b83-d37b-4d5d-92ad-f3f4c57a3621"
  });
  capture.listen("populate", (address, varients) => {
    console.log(address, varients, "populate")
  })
</script>
```

### Initialisation

When you instantiate a new **Capture** object you will get a reference to an
object commonly referred to as the **control** object.

```javascript
let control = new Capture(fields, options);
```

The constructor takes two arguments, **fields** and **options**.

The **fields** argument lets the control know what fields it should use for a
search term, and what data to put where when an address is selected by the user.

The **options** argument allows you to set a variety of options to specify how
the control will behave. The only required option is 'key', which should be a
string representation of your api key.

```javascript
"bafe2b83-d37b-4d5d-92ad-f3f4c57a3621";
```

The resulting control object provides all methods and properties to customise
the address capture experience.

**Note:** You will typically have one of the these objects for each of your
address forms, so it is important to give them individual references or store
them in a list.

```javascript
let billingControl = new Capture(billingFields, billingOptions);
let shippingControl = new Capture(shippingFields, shippingOptions);
```

Before calling methods on the control you should listen for the **load** event
to ensure the control is ready.

```javascript
let control = new Capture(fields, options);

control.listen("load", function () {
  control.setCountry("CAN");
});
```

### Mapping your fields

The address capture control needs to know which elements of the address should
be put into each of your fields. It also needs to know which fields should be
used for searching and which field (if any) contains the country. This
information is provided in a standard format, which is an array of objects that
have an **element**, **field** and optional **mode** property.

```javascript
let fields = [
  { element: "#search", field: "" },
  {
    element: "#company",
    field: "company",
    mode: FieldMode.DEFAULT | FieldMode.PRESERVE,
  },
  { element: "#line1", field: "line1" },
  { element: "#line2", field: "line2", mode: FieldMode.POPULATE },
  { element: "#city", field: "city", mode: FieldMode.POPULATE },
  { element: "#state", field: "province", mode: FieldMode.POPULATE },
  { element: "#postcode", field: "postalCode" },
  { element: "#country", field: "countryName", mode: FieldMode.COUNTRY },
];
```

#### The code explained

- **element** is a query selector string for your field, or the input element
  itself.

- **field** is the name of the address element that should be put into this
  field. For a list of the available fields see the Capture Interactive
  Retrieve. The field can also take the form of a format string, which is
  detailed in the next section.

- **mode** will tell the control how this field should be used. There are four
  options which can be set or combined together. The default setting is
  **SEARCH** and **POPULATE**. Field modes are declared in the **FieldMode**
  enum. It is a bitset field and modes can be combined using the JavaScript
  bitwise OR operator (|)

  - **SEARCH** will enable autocomplete searching from the field. When the user
    clicks into this field the control will be shown and, as they type,
    suggestions will appear.
  - **POPULATE** will cause the control to set the field value based on the
    address that the user selected. This mode is almost always used but, in the
    event that you wish to handle the population of fields yourself, you can
    ignore it.
  - **COUNTRY** will cause the control to display the country list when the user
    selects the field. The control will also attempt to read the value of this
    field when it loads and set the country to search in.
  - **PRESERVE** is used to prevent the control from overwriting fields which
    might have already been populated by the user, prior to searching for their
    address. A good use case for this is company name. If the field already has
    a value the control will not overwrite it, but if the field is currently
    blank it will be populated.

| poBoxNumber      | The PO Box Number part of the address.                                                                                                                                              |

### Advanced field formats

To define complex or custom field values, the control makes use of template
strings. The template strings work by replacing field values from the selected
address, based on field names which are enclosed in curly brackets, for example
"**\{postalCode}**".

```javascript
let fields = [{ element: "#postcode", field: "{postalCode}" }];
```

Any regular text or HTML can be included in the template strings around the
field values, such as "**\<b>\{line1}\</b>, \{line2}**".

```javascript
let fields = [{ element: "#lin1and2", field: "{line1}, {line2}" }];
```

Conditional formatting can be added by enclosing the field, and any additional
text which is conditional on the field having a value, in a second set of curly
brackets. If the template string was "**\{line1}\{, \{line2}}**" then the comma
would not appear unless the selected address had a second address line.

```javascript
let fields = [{ element: "#line1And2IfItExists", field: "{line1}{, {line2}}" }];
```

Finally, field values will always appear in title case, but can easily be
capitalised by adding an exclamation mark (!) at the end of the field name, like
this "**\{city!}**".

```javascript
let fields = [{ element: "#capitalisedCity", field: "{city!}" }];
```

### Setting options

The second parameter that is required by the address control is a configuration
object. This is used to set options and customise how the control behaves. The
only required option is the API key that you will be using to access the web
services.

```javascript
let options = {
  key: "bafe2b83-d37b-4d5d-92ad-f3f4c57a3621",
};
```

Further options can be set by adding more information to the configuration
object. To create a control that limits addresses to the United States and
Canada, but set the country based upon the users IP address, you would define
the following object:

```javascript
let options = {
  key: "bafe2b83-d37b-4d5d-92ad-f3f4c57a3621",
  countries: {
    codesList: "USA,CAN",
  },
};
```

### Limiting the search to specific countries

Capture+ is designed to be a truly international address verification and
standardisation solution, and will by default allow you to search through all of
the countries that we cover.

However, you can limit the countries that Capture+ will search by adding search
settings into your options object.

For example, to create a control that was limited to the United States and
Canada, but set the country based upon the users IP address, you would define
the following object:

```javascript
let options = {
  key: "bafe2b83-d37b-4d5d-92ad-f3f4c57a3621",
  countries: {
    codesList: "USA,CAN",
  },
};
```

### Translation

Both the control and web service API support a variety of language cultures. The
language is automatically detected from the user's web browser but we also
provide a **culture** option and **setCulture** method. The culture is based on
2-character code (e.g. “en”, “fr”) or culture name (e.g. “en_GB”, “en_US”,
“fr_FR”, “fr_CA”).

```javascript
let options = {
  key: "bafe2b83-d37b-4d5d-92ad-f3f4c57a3621",
  culture: "fr",
};
```

### Events and listeners

The address capture library implements a simple events model which will allow
you to listen out for when certain things happen. To listen for an event use the
**listen** method with the event name and a function to run when that event
occurs. Events can sometimes pass additional details through parameters.

```javascript
control.listen("populate", function (address, variations) {
  document.getElementById("myCustomField").value = address.PostalCode;
});
```

<Accordion
title="View all available events"
>
  The following events can be listened for on the control object.

| Event       | What it means                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### Retrieving co-ordinate data

To get coordinates you will need to map **\{latitude}** and **\{longitude}** to
fields:

```javascript
let fields = [
  { element: "#latitude", field: "latitude" },
  { element: "#longitude", field: "longitude" },
];
```

Royal Mail PAF contains **postcode** level coordinate information. AddressBase
and the following countries that are covered by TomTom, provide
**premise-level** coordinates: Andorra, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium,
Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France,
Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Jordan,
Kuwait, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macao, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway,
Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, San Marino, Singapore, Slovakia,
Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Türkiye, Ukraine, United Arab
Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Vietnam.

### Common customisations

#### Adding a manual entry item:

You can add an item which will appear at the bottom of the list at the end of a
search, and will allow the user to enter their address without autocomplete.
When the user selects the item, the **manual** event will be fired and control
will be disabled while they enter their address. This can be done by setting the
**manualEntryItem** option to **true** or calling the **addManualEntryItem**
method.

#### Hiding and showing the control:

To manually hide the control it is best to call the **control.destroy** method.
This will remove the control from the page and stop it listening to any events.
You can reload the control at any time by calling the **control.load** method.

### Optimising your address form

There are a few things that can make a form easier to work with:

- Create input fields which are appropriate for the data type, we would
  recommend that you have:

  - Between 2 and 5 text input boxes for the address lines. Address structures
    around the world will vary, so make your main address input flexible enough
    for anyone to enter their details.
  - Separate text input fields for the city and postal code.
  - Either text inputs or select lists for the state/province and country.
    Address Verification can work well with select lists, but make sure you use
    a recognised name for the text value, and codes for the option id. We make
    use of the ISO 3166 standard country names and regions.

- Make sure each of your fields has a unique id. An id which is related to the
  information you are expecting to capture will be helpful, for example:
  “line1”, “line2”, “city”, “state”, “postcode”, “country”. You can prefix or
  suffix each id to distinguish between different address forms, e.g.
  “billing_line1”, “shipping_line1”

- Let the user know what kind of information you want from them. Make use of
  HTML label elements and input placeholder attributes.

- Do not force too much validation upon the user. Address Verification will help
  them avoid mistakes as they enter their address, but you can still allow them
  to modify it and add extra detail where necessary.

### Troubleshooting

If the address capture control is not working, there a few things to check:

#### The control is loading before the fields have been rendered

The control will wait until the DOM has finished loading before it initialises,
but still this can sometimes be before your address fields have been added to
the page. Check out the dynamic pages section of this guide for solutions to
this issue.

#### There is an error somewhere on the page

Most modern web browsers will come with built in developer tools. On most
systems this is accessed by pressing **F12**. Check the console section of your
developer tools for any error information which should help with diagnosing the
issue.

#### Account or key settings

Make sure that you are using the correct key in your code. If there any issues
with your account or key settings you should receive an email from us
automatically.

### Dynamic pages

The control will bind to your mapped fields as soon as it is initialised. This
becomes more tricky when working with dynamic pages and asynchronous postbacks.
If you need to rebind your control you can call **reload** on the control
object. The control will them re-bind to the currently available fields.

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">control.reload();</script>
```
