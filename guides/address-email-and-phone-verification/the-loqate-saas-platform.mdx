title: "The Loqate Saas Platform"
---

We have launched our new Saas platform in North America, introducing a new way
of accessing Loqate functionality. You can use either/or the Saas platform and
our Classic platform, but over time you're going to see more and more of Loqate
evolve into this new platform. In this article we're going to talk about what
the Saas Platform is, and how to understand which version of the Loqate platform
you are currently using.

<Warning>
  At present this is only available for customers in North America, but we'll
  reach out with more information as and when it's available more widely.
</Warning>

## What is the Loqate Saas platform?

The new Saas platform combines a brand new account experience with an updated
way of using Address Capture, providing a better experience for you than ever
before.

As it stands, you can use the Saas platform to access Address Capture, andwe
will provide further details as additional Loqate products become available to
use. In the meantime, if you currently use products other than Address Capture
you can continue to access them via the Classic platform, while taking advantage
of the Saas platform for Capture.

If you are an existing North American customer and would like to use the Saas
platform, please visit [loqate.com](https://www.loqate.com/) andcreate a new
account - this will automatically generate a Saas platform account for you,
which you can use for Address Capture alongside your existing Classic platform
account (for everything else).

## How do I know which platform I'm using?

If you're not sure whether you're using the Saas or Classic platform, we've put
together some guidance for how to identify exactly what you're using.

There are a few different ways to see whether you're using the Saas or Classic
platform - you can:

- Check the URL that you're using to log in to your account
- Check the URL of the endpoint(s) you're using
- Compare the structure of your API keys
- Look for the visual differences between the two platforms

### Account URLs

The New and Classic platforms each use different URLs when you're logging in:

- **Saas
  platform:** [https://app-us.platform.loqate.com/](https://app-us.platform.loqate.com/)

- **Classic
  platform:** [https://account.loqate.com/](https://account.loqate.com/)

### Endpoint URLS

Similarly, the Saas and Classic platforms use different URLs for the endpoints
that you call when making API requests:

- **Saas
  platform:&#xA0;** [api-us.platform.loqate.com](http://api-us.platform.loqate.com/)

  - For example, a Capture FIND call might look
    like [https://api-us.platform.loqate.com/address-capture/find](https://api-us.platform.loqate.com/address-capture/find)

- **Classic
  platform:** [api.addressy.com](http://api.addressy.com/) or [services.postcodeanywhere.co.uk](https://services.postcodeanywhere.co.uk/Capture/Interactive/Find/v1.10/json3.ws)

  - For example, a Capture FIND call might look
    like [https://api.addressy.com/Capture/Interactive/Find/v1.10/](https://api.addressy.com/Capture/Interactive/Find/v1.10/)
  - Or
    [https://services.postcodeanywhere.co.uk/Capture/Interactive/Find/v1.10/](https://services.postcodeanywhere.co.uk/Capture/Interactive/Find/v1.10/json3.ws)

### API keys

You might not look at your API keys on a regular basis, but if you compare Saas
platform and Classic platform keys you'll notice that they're structured quite
differently:

- **Saas platform** keys are structured in five groups of digits (broken down as
  8-4-4-4-12), i.e. XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
- **Classic platform** keys are structured in four groups of four alphanumeric
  digits, i.e. AAXX-BBXX-CCXX-DDXX

### Visuals

When accessing your account section, both thelogin screen and the main home
screen will look different depending on which platform you're using.

The **Saas platform** looks like this:

</Frame>

The **Classic platform** looks like this:

</Frame>

discuss anything about the differences between the two,
