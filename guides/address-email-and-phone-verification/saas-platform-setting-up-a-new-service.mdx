title: "SaaS Platform: Setting Up A New Service"
---

Setting up a new service via the Loqate Saas Platform is quick and easy, and in
this article we'll take you through the few steps required to get started.

<Warning>
  Before setting up a new service, make sure you have a Loqate account. If you
  don't already have one, you can [sign up
  here](https://app-us.platform.loqate.com/sign-up/) - **please note that the
  Saas Platform is currently only available inNorth America**.
</Warning>
There are three short steps to take to set up a new service: add a service,
choose a name, and data protection.

Here's a short video demonstrating these steps. Read on for more details once
you've watched the video.

### Add a service

First, select either **Add a service** on your account Overview page, or **Add
another service** on the Services page.

### Choose a name

Next, choose a name for your new service. We recommend you use as clear and
recognisable a name as possible, for ease of identifying which service is which
at a later date.

### Data protection

On the same page, you'll be asked to fill in some details for the purposes of
data protection.

If you are not going to be using this service to process data of individuals who
live in the UK or EU, then just select **No**, and then click the **Create**
button to complete the process and finalise your new service.

If you are, however, going to be processing UK or EU customer data, select
**Yes** - after which you will be presented with some additional questions.

First, you'll be asked to choose a reason for processing the data, from a
drop-down list:

</Frame>

Next, you'll be asked whether you're the person responsible for data privacy in
your organisation.

If you are responsible, select **Yes** and then enter your phone number into the
field that is presented:

</Frame>

If you are not responsible, select **No** and then enter the name, registered
company address, email address and phone number of whoever in your organisation
is responsible for data privacy.

Once you have completed this section of the form, click **Create** to finish -
your service is now configured, and ready to integrate.

By default you'll be taken to the **SDK Integration** page next, which contains
full details of how to integrate your new service using our SDK
([also available here](/guides/address-email-and-phone-verification/saas-platform-sdk)).

If you would prefer though, you can instead select **API Key & Reference** for
the full API integration guide (also available here).
