Address Capture suggests possible addresses based on user input.

The integration works as follows:

Calls to the [Find](/apis/address-capture/interactive-find-v1.1/) endpoint are made continuously until an address of type `Address` is found
If the type is `Container`, the system continues making calls to the Find endpoint
Once an address of type `Address` is found, the Retrieve endpoint is called to capture the full address details

## IP to Country

The IP to Country feature determines the userâ€™s country based on their IP address. The country field is auto-populated with the result.

**Supported configuration options:**

- `LOQATE_IP_TO_COUNTRY_ENABLED` - toggle for IP to country functionality on or off
- `LOQATE_ADDRESS_LOOKUP_CHECKOUT` - toggle for address lookup during checkout
- `LOQATE_ADDRESS_LOOKUP_MY_ACCOUNT` - toggle for address lookup on the "My Account" page

Address Verifiy evaluates the validity of the user-inputted address upon form submission. The system validates the address using fields like country, city, postal code, and street address. Based on Address Verify's response, the address is scored as either `Good`, `Questionable`, or `Invalid` using the provided `Address Verification Code`.

1. **Good Address:** no issues detected
2. **Questionable Address:** the user is prompted to accept a corrected address suggested by Address Verify. The user can either edit the address manually or proceed with the initial input
3. **Invalid Address:** a suggestion is provided to update the address. The user can either update or proceed with the original input

**Supported configuration options:**

- `LOQATE_ADDRESS_VERIFICATION_CHECKOUT` - toggle for address verification during checkout
- `LOQATE_ADDRESS_VERIFICATION_MY_ACCOUNT` - toggle for address verification on the "My Account" page
- `LOQATE_AVC` - minimum matchscore threshold for an address to be considered Good
