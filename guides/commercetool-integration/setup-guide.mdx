### LoqateController

The `LoqateController` is a key component that interacts with the Loqate API to handle address capture, address verification, and validation for email and phone numbers. It serves as the gateway for these services, ensuring they are integrated within the commercetools environment.

#### Key features:

- **Loqate API Client:** the controller initializes the `LoqateApi` client, configured with project settings like API key, address quality threshold, and validation timeouts
- **Address Management:** it provides methods for capturing, verifying, and validating addresses based on user input
- **Email & Phone Validation:** the controller includes email and phone validation methods that ensure the correctness of these fields as per the rules defined in the Loqate API
- **IP-based Country Detection:** it enables the retrieval of the user's country based on their IP address for better geolocation-based address suggestions

### Controller functions overview

1. `createLoqateApi(actionContext: ActionContext): LoqateApi`

## Frontend changes

### Loqate Context

The `LoqateContext` provides a centralized state management system for Loqate-related features such as address capture, address verification, email validation, and phone validation. It encapsulates multiple Loqate API integrations and makes them accessible to components throughout the application via React’s context API.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- **Address Lookup:** Listens to user input and fetches address suggestions from the Loqate API, debouncing the requests to reduce unnecessary API calls. The context updates the suggested addresses list and allows the user to select an address.

- **Address Verification:** Verifies the address provided by the user using the Loqate API. It triggers validation when an address is manually entered or submitted. The context validates the address based on the Loqate response, ensuring its accuracy.

- **Email and Phone Validation:** Integrates email and phone number validation, with the ability to validate inputs using the corresponding Loqate APIs. Results are stored in the context for use across components like checkout or user account management.

- **IP-to-Country Mapping:** Automatically fills in the country based on the user's IP address, improving user experience and preventing invalid country selections.

Here’s a detailed description of the exposed functions in the `LoqateContext`:

**Exposed functions**

1. `setLoqateAddress(value: LoqateAddress)`

- **Description:** updates the current address stored in the context based on the user's input or address selection. It triggers address suggestions when the input changes and resets the address verification state if the address changes
- **Use case:** called whenever the user updates their address input, whether through manual input or selecting an address from the suggestions dropdown
- **Parameters:**
  - **`value`:** the updated address object containing fields like `text`, `city`, `countryIsoCode`, etc.

2. `verifyAddress(loqateAddress: LoqateAddress): Promise<LoqateIsValidAddress>`

- **Description:** verifies the provided address using the Loqate API to ensure it's valid. It returns a LoqateIsValidAddress object, indicating whether the address is valid or not
- **Use case:** used to validate addresses during adding of new address in My Account or checkout processes where accurate address entry is critical
- **Parameters:**
  - **`loqateAddress`:** the address object that needs to be verified
- **Returns:** a promise resolving to an object with `isValid: true` or `false` depending on whether the address is valid

3. `validateEmail(): Promise<boolean | undefined>`

- **Description:** validates the email address associated with the current Loqate address. If Email Validation is enabled in the Loqate settings, it sends the email to Loqate's validation API and updates the context with the result
- **Use case:** triggered to validate an email when users input their email address in a form, commonly during registration or checkout
- **Returns:** a promise resolving to a boolean indicating whether the email is valid (`true`/`false`), or `undefined` if validation is not enabled

4. `validatePhone(): Promise<boolean | undefined>`

- **Description:** validates the phone number provided in the LoqateAddress object using the Loqate API. If Phone Validation is enabled, it checks the number's format and correctness based on the country
- **Use case:** used to validate phone numbers during form submission (e.g., in checkout forms) to ensure that the provided number is valid
- **Returns:** a promise resolving to a boolean indicating whether the phone number is valid (`true`/`false`), or `undefined` if validation is not enabled

5. `setBypassAddressVerification(bypass: boolean)`

- **Description:** sets a flag to bypass Address Verify. This is useful in scenarios where the user wants to skip the verification process or manually override an invalid address
- **Use case:** typically used when users manually input invalid or questionable addresses and opt to bypass automatic verification
- **Parameters:**
  - **`bypass`:** a boolean value that, when set to `true`, bypasses Address Verify

6. `setLoqateSettings(loqateSettings: LoqateSettings)`

- **Description:** updates the Loqate settings used for address lookup and validation, including enabling or disabling email, phone, and address validation features
- **Use case:** used to configure or reconfigure Loqate settings dynamically (e.g., different pages might require different settings)
- **Parameters:**
  - **`loqateSettings`:** the settings object that dictates how Loqate functionality is used (e.g., enabling/disabling email or phone validation)

The context handles API calls using RxJS operators like `debounceTime`, `distinctUntilChanged`, and `switchMap` to manage user input efficiently and ensure smooth address verification and lookup processes.

### Address Capture

The AddressCapture component is responsible for capturing and suggesting addresses based on user input. It integrates seamlessly with the Loqate Context and allows for dynamic address suggestions and selection.

**Key features:**

- **Input field:** the component displays an input field where users can begin typing their address. As they type, the component fetches address suggestions from Loqate based on the user's input

- **Address suggestions dropdown:** while the input field is focused, the component shows a dropdown of suggested addresses. These suggestions come from the Loqate API, and users can click on any suggestion to populate the address fields automatically

- **Manual and auto address handling:** the component supports both manual entry and auto-selection of addresses. If a user selects an address from the dropdown, the address is treated as an auto-populated value, while manual entries bypass the suggestion feature

- **Debouncing and API efficiency:** to minimize API calls, user input is debounced, ensuring that requests are only sent after a specified delay in typing

- **Handling nested addresses (address containers):** in cases where the address suggestion is a container (e.g., a boulevard that contains many addresses), the component displays an icon, allowing the user to recognize such cases and continue refining their search

### Restricted Countries

This code defines a React custom hook called `useRestrictedCountries` that retrieves and manages the list of countries that are not restricted, filtering out any countries that are restricted based on an external API call to the loqate/`getRestrictedCountries` action via the `commercetools` SDK.

**Key elements**

1. **State management:**

- `countries`: this state holds the list of available countries, which is initialized with a static list of all countries (`allCountries`)
- `fetchingInProgress`: a boolean state to track if the fetching process is currently ongoing
- `successfullyFetched`: a boolean state indicating whether the fetching was successfully completed

2. **API integration:**

- The `fetchRestrictedCountries` function asynchronously calls the `loqate/getRestrictedCountries` API action using the `commercetools SDK`. It expects a response containing restricted country codes

3. **Logic for filtering restricted countries:**

- The API response provides a list of restricted countries
- The list of restricted countries is mapped and filtered to remove any invalid entries (i.e., missing or empty country codes)
- The hook filters out the restricted countries from the full list (`allCountries`)

4. **Side effects (useEffect):**

- On component mount, the hook triggers the API call to fetch restricted countries
- During this process, `fetchingInProgress` is set to `true` and `successfullyFetched` is updated based on whether the call succeeds or fails
- In case of an error, the hook logs the error and falls back to the default list of all countries

5. **Observable and RxJS integration:**

- The code uses RxJS operators (`map`, `tap`, `catchError`) to handle the API call, map the response, and manage error handling
- The `subscribe` function applies the country filtering logic and updates the `countries` state accordingly
