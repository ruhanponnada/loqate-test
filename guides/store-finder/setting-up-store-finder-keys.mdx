title: "Setting Up Store Finder Keys"

All of our services require API keys in order to work, which you can create in
[your account](https://account.loqate.com/) - see the
[Creating API Keys page](# "Creating API Keys") for full details of how to do
this.

In this article we'll quickly explain the specifics of creating API keys for use
with a Store Finder.

#### Store Finder API keys

You need to create a dedicated service for your Store Finder. On the _Add
service_ page you'll see a **Store Finder** option - click on this to get
started.

This will then create two keys for you:

- A **Service** key, which should be used for all of the public-facing aspects
  of a Store Finder such as your calls to our Geocoding, Distance Finder and
  Mapping APIs
- A **Management** key, which should be kept private and only used to access our
  Location Management APIs for creating, editing and deleting your lists

Here's an example of how those keys will look:

You can now edit the settings for your keys (such as name, daily limit and
security restrictions), or just get started with adding a Store Finder to your
site.

Before you get coding, you will want to add a list of Locations that you can
use. You can do this either
[in your account](/guides/store-finder/creating-and-managing-location-lists "Creating and managing location lists")
or via our
[Create List API](/apis/store-finder/location-management-create-list/ "Location Management Create List").
