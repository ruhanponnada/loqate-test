Location Lists allow you to group together multiple locations - including
associated information about each - that you can then use as part of a Store
Finder tool.

There are two ways to create a Location List - via the
[Create List API](/apis/store-finder/location-management-create-list/ "Location Management Create List"),
or via your Loqate account at
[account.loqate.com](https://account.loqate.com/account#/). In this guide we'll
take you through the process of creating, editing and deleting Location Lists
within the account section. These lists can then be used in our
[Distance Finder API](/apis/store-finder/global-distance-finder/ "Global Distance Finder")
to calculate distances between an end user and your stores (or other locations).

<CustomInfo image="/images/1020137f-support-customer.svg" imageSize="120px">
  A Location List should contain all the information you want to display to
  customers about your stores, including their names, co-ordinates and their
  IDs. It can also contain additional information (such as a description of each
  location, opening times, and address), to provide further context that your
  end users might find helpful.
</CustomInfo>
This guide is split up into the following sections:

- Creating a Location List
- Uploading locations
- Viewing and editing locations
- Deleting a list
- Finding an existing list

### Creating a Location List

To create a new Location list, go to the
[Add Service page](https://account.loqate.com/account#/Setup/) in your account
section and select **Location List** from the grid of service options.

### Naming your list

This will open the Location List setup screen where you can give your list a
name and description. We recommend you give your list a clear, easy to remember
name and description for easier identification later on.

### Uploading your locations

Once you have given your list a name, the option to upload your list as a CSV
file will appear.

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/93be9c95-location-list-3.png" />
</Frame>

Any CSV file you upload must contain the mandatory headers of **Name**,
**Description**, **Address**, **Latitude** and **Longitude**, while it can also
contain additional optional headers related to store opening hours. You can
download an example CSV template at the bottom of the page.

If you want to geocode your locations (i.e. you have the addresses but no
co-ordinates), you can select the **Geocode Address** toggle and we will append
those for you up to a maximum of 500 locations per list.

<CustomInfo image="/images/1020137f-support-customer.svg" imageSize="120px">
  Please note that each address geocoded constitutes one geocoding charge
  against your account. When using this option please ensure that you have a
  valid address for each line in your CSV, otherwise the upload will fail.
</CustomInfo>
Click on the **Browse&#x20;**&#x62;utton to select your file, then the
**Upload&#x20;**&#x62;utton to upload and save your locations.

You'll see the name of your selected file displayed underneath, along with its
upload status.

<CustomInfo image="/images/1020137f-support-customer.svg" imageSize="120px">
  When locations are uploaded they are automatically assigned an ID. This means
  that if you download a list at a later date you can edit the fields of
  individual locations and, provided you don't change their IDs, can reupload it
  to modify an existing list.
</CustomInfo>

Once your file is uploaded, you now have a complete Location List with an ID
that's ready to use with our Distance Finder endpoint. Please keep a note of the
List ID that is automatically generated as this will be the primary identifier
used with any of our APIs.

### Viewing and editing locations

Once a list has been uploaded, you can go to the **Locations&#x20;**&#x74;ab to
view all of the locations within that list. You can use the search field to
filter through these if required, or select **Download list** to export the list
back to a CSV file.

</Frame>

From here you can either edit or delete individual locations. To **delete** a
location, click the bin icon on the relevant line of the table.

Click the notepad icon next to a location to **edit** it - this will take you to
the following screen.

</Frame>

From here you can edit each of the individual fields associated with a location,
including opening times.

### Deleting a list

If you decide that you no longer need a Location List, you can remove it in the
**Delete&#x20;**&#x74;ab.

</Frame>

<Warning>
  **Please note that deletion is permanent as we do not keep backups once a list
  has been marked as deleted.**
</Warning>

### Finding an existing list

Once you have created a list, you'll need to know where to find it in your
Account section if you want to edit or delete it in future.

To do this, start by going to the Menu in the top right of the Account section
and selecting **Your Services**.

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/3684e480-location-list-9.png" />
</Frame>

From there you will be presented with a list of your installations, API keys and
Location Lists. You can filter through these by using the search bar.

<Frame caption="">

Once you have found your list, select it to go to the Configuration screen for
that list.
