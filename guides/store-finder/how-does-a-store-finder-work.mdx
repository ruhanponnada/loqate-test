title: "How Does A Store Finder Work?"

import { CustomInfo } from "/snippets/CustomInfo.mdx";

In principle, a Store Finder tool works by allowing you to combine precise
location information for your organisation's stores and a customer's location,
then determining the relationship between the two sets of information, and
presenting the results in a visual fashion.

The key elements that you need in order to make a Store Finder work are:

- A list of locations (generally referring to your stores, but this could be any
  other locations relevant to your business and your customers such as
  collection points or drop-off lockers)
- Additional (optional) useful information about each location
- Your customer's current location
- A method for identifying which of your locations are closest to your
  customer - calculated using either distance or time metrics, depending on what
  your customer wants
- A method of visually presenting this information, and allowing the customer to
  select specific locations and see relevant information about each one

This sort of tool (or combinations of its components) can be used in lots of
different ways, but for the purposes of this article we're going to focus on the
Store Finder use case.

### How do Loqate APIs interact to build a Store Finder?

The Loqate Store Finder product is comprised of a series of APIs which interact
with each other to fulfil all of the steps mentioned above. In this section
we'll go into a little more detail about how this works.

The APIs in question fall into the following categories (click on the links
below if you want to read the relevant API reference documentation):

- Location Management:

  - [Create List](/apis/store-finder/location-management-create-list/ "Location Management Create List")
  - [Update List or Point](/apis/store-finder/location-management-update-list-or-point/ "Location Management Update List or Point")
  - [Delete List or Point](/apis/store-finder/location-management-delete-list-or-point/ "Location Management Delete List or Point")
  - [Get List](/apis/store-finder/location-management-get-list/ "Location Management Get List")

- [Global Geocoding](/apis/store-finder/global-geocoding/ "Global Geocoding")

- [Distance Finder](/apis/store-finder/global-distance-finder/ "Global Distance Finder")

- [Mapping](/apis/store-finder/map-tile-api/ "Map Tile API")

Here's a diagram to show how the APIs fit together in a finished Store Finder:

Let's take a closer look now at how they work.

#### Location Management

The first thing you need to decide where you will host your list of stores or
locations that you want your customers to visit. There are three options for
doing this:

- Upload one or more lists in a CSV format via your account
  ([www.account.loqate.com](http://www.account.loqate.com)). This method
  requires no technical skills, and is generally better for lists that don't
  need changing or updating frequently, and that you're happy to update manually
- Upload one or more lists via the
  [Create List API](/apis/store-finder/location-management-create-list/ "Location Management Create List").
  This method is generally better if you have a list that requires updating
  frequently, or you want to programmatically create and edit lists rather than
  doing this manually
- Host a list yourself or with a third party. If you don't want to send us your
  locations, or you already have them stored elsewhere, you can simply pass the
  co-ordinates of your locations (and any other optional information) to our
  [Distance Finder API](/apis/store-finder/global-distance-finder/ "Global Distance Finder")
  later on

Regardless of which method you choose, this list will form the basis of your
Store Finder. At this point you can also append information about each store,
such as opening hours, or contact details - this information can then be
displayed to your customers at a later point.

<Warning>
  It's crucial that we have co-ordinates for each of your stores, for use later
  on in the process. If you have addresses but not co-ordinates, don't worry -
  we can append them for you when you upload. You can either request this as a
  parameter when you call the Create List API, or select it as an option in your
  account.
</Warning>
If you need to make changes to any of your lists (or individual location points
within one of them) then you can also do that, using one of the following APIs:

- Make changes using the
  [Update List or Point API](/apis/store-finder/location-management-update-list-or-point/ "Location Management Update List or Point")
- Delete lists you don't want/need any more using the
  [Delete List or Point API](/apis/store-finder/location-management-delete-list-or-point/ "Location Management Delete List or Point")
- See the details of all the locations within a list using the
  [Get List API](/apis/store-finder/location-management-get-list/ "Location Management Get List")

<CustomInfo image="/images/1020137f-support-customer.svg" imageSize="120px">
  If you have stores in multiple regions you can either create multiple lists
  for each region, or combine them into one. Creating multiple smaller lists can
  be beneficial to improve performance, and help manage different Store Finders
  for different countries.
</CustomInfo>

#### Geocoding

Once you have at least one list of your stores, the next thing to do is to
identify your customer's current location.

The
[Global Geocoding API](/apis/store-finder/global-geocoding/ "Global Geocoding")
takes a customer's address, post code or locality (inputted by the customer into
an appropriate field on your website), and returns a set of co-ordinates
identifying where that location is in the world.

You can then take these co-ordinates and pass them into our Distance Finder API
in the next step.

#### Distance Finder

At this point in the process you have the locations of each of your stores, and
the location of your end user. The next task is to identify which of your stores
are closest to your customer, so that you can (in the next step) present the
most appropriate options back to them.

We can can calculate this for you by passing the following two pieces of
information into our
[Global Distance Finder API](/apis/store-finder/global-distance-finder/ "Global Distance Finder"):

- The co-ordinates of your customer that you received from our Geocoding API
- Either the ID of your Location List, or the locations (via an array including
  ID, name and lat/long co-ordinates for each) that you have passed to use as
  part of the API request

This API will return all the stores within a given radius, along with any other
information you have chosen to supply about those stores. It will also provide
the road-based distance and travel time between your customer and each of your
stores.

Road-based distances are preferential to straight line distance calculations, as
they give a more realistic and precise view of how far away a store actually is.
With straight line distances, geographic features such as bodies of water or
non-traversable land are ignored, meaning that a customer could be pointed
towards a store that isn't actually their closest one, giving them a worse
experience.

Travel time is also a useful metric for customers as it allows them to quickly
relate to the distances being shown. For example, if a store is 15 minutes away
a customer can quickly determine whether they could make it there and back on
their lunch break, increasing their chances of visiting the store.

You can then render these results as part of a side bar in your Store Finder,
allowing users to see a list of your stores and any other relevant information.

#### Mapping

Lastly, you need a way of presenting this information to your end user on a map
so that they can physically see where each store is located.

The [Map Tile API](/apis/store-finder/map-tile-api/ "Map Tile API") allows you
to retrieve map tiles for given co-ordinates. In combination with a map renderer
library such as Maplibre or Leaflet this can be used to display your store
locations on them. As we are only providing the basemap data and the tiles you
are free to style your locations based on your own site design.
