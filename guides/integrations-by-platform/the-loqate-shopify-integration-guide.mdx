[Download from the Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/loqate)

The Loqate Shopify Plus Integration, downloadable via the Shopify App Store,
allows you to quickly and easily add Loqate's address validation services to the
checkout page of your Shopify Plus site. With some or all of these services
enabled you can provide your customers with type-ahead lookup functionality for
address fields (reducing both input times and the likelihood of errors),
verification for manually-entered addresses, and email address validation.

We've created this integration to take advantage of Shopify's new Checkout
Extensibility functionality, which means you can leverage Shopify's latest
technology as part of the Loqate app.

Installing and setting up this Shopify Plus app is a straightforward process,
and in this guide we will take you through the handful of quick steps required
to get up and running. You don't need any in-depth technical knowledge in order
to install this app, just familiarity with Shopify Plus.

## Available services: Address Capture, Address Verify and Email Validation

The Loqate Shopify Plus Integration includes three Loqate services:

- **Address Capture**, which provides a type-ahead solution for address input
- **Address Verify**, which ensures the accuracy of manually-entered addresses
- **Email Validation**, which ensures the accuracy of customer email addresses

Read on to find out more about what each service does, and how they complement
each other.

<Warning>
  NOTE: these services are designed to work together, but each one can be
  enabled/disabled individually. Address Capture is enabled by default, but
  while it's not recommended it is possible to disable Address Capture and use
  just Address Verify and/or Email Validation. See the '[Use without Address
  Capture](#UseWithout)' section below for more details.
</Warning>

#### Address Capture

This is active by default once you've installed and configured the app, adding
type-ahead address lookup functionality to the Address field on your checkout
form and allowing customers to start typing in their address and then select the
relevant one from a list of suggested addresses.

Address Capture is available in both the Delivery address and Billing address
sections.

#### Address Verify

If enabled, Address Verify adds an extra layer of verification by checking
addresses against our reference data using a process of correction,
standardisation, formatting, enhancement and verification. If appropriate, it
canthen offer an alternative which the customer can either agree to use, or
dismiss in favour of their original entry.

Address Verify is available on theThank You page, post-checkout, and can make
changes to customers' delivery addresses (it doesn't affect the billing
address).

<Warning>
  **NOTE:** <br /> Address Verify can also be added totheDelivery address
  section of the checkout page, but this option is now deprecated and will be
  removed in time. We strongly recommend that you don't use Address Verify to
  the checkout page, and **only** use the post-checkout option, as this allows
  you to use Address Verify alongside functions such as wallets (for
  Apple/Google Pay) and logged-in users. If you already have Address Verify
  enabled for the checkout page, we recommend you disable this and enable the
  post-checkout option instead.
</Warning>
#### Email Validation

This is an optional feature which, if enabled, allows you to validate customer
email addresses as they're being entered. If a customer enters an invalid email
address\*, they will be notified that the email address can't be validated and
won't be able to proceed through the checkout form until they enter a valid
email address.

Otherwise, customers who enter valid email addresses will not have their
experience interrupted or visually altered in any way.

\*See the 'Response fields' section of the
[Email Validation API documentation](/apis/email-validation/)
for details of why an email address might be invalid.

## Prerequisites

Before you start installing and setting up the Loqate Shopify Plus Integration,
you will need the following:

- A live Shopify Plus account
- A live Loqate account
- A new Loqate API key (see the API keys section below for more information on
  this)

### Loqate accounts

You can use the Loqate Shopify Plus app with both the Loqate Saas platform
(available to North American customers) and Classic platform. If you're in the
US and you're not sure which platform you're using, see
our [guide to the Loqate Saas Platform](/guides/address-email-and-phone-verification/the-loqate-saas-platform/).

It's important to note, however, that Address Verify functionality is only
available via the Classic platform. You can use both Address Capture and Address
Verify with a single Classic platform API key.

### API keys

You'll need a new Loqate API key, dedicated to this service (our
[Creating API Keys page](/loqate-basics/creating-api-keys/)
has lots of information about how to set one up, and what to consider when
you're doing that).For the Loqate Saas platform you can use any key; for the
Classic platform we recommend you create a*generic* API key, but any key will
work.

For information about how to ensure your Loqate integration is as secure as
possible, see
our [API Security](/loqate-basics/api-security/) page.

## Installation

There are a few quick steps to get the Loqate Shopify Plus Integration up and
running:

- Install and configure the Loqate app (which you can find
  [here](https://apps.shopify.com/loqate))

  - [Basic setup](#Basic)
  - [Enabling Address Capture](#EnablingCapture)
  - [Enabling Address Verify](#EnablingVerify)
  - [Enabling Email Validation](#EnablingEmail)

- [Recommended: include company name](#IncludeCompanyName)

As well as those key actions, there are also some additional steps that you can
follow if required:

Follow these steps in order, and you'll get up and running quickly and easily.
If you need help you can contact [support@loqate.com](mailto:support@loqate.com).

### Installing and configuring the Loqate app

The initial setup will add the Loqate app to your Shopify store, at which point
Address Capture will be enabled by default. You can then alsoenableAddress
Verify and/or Email Validation.

#### Basic setup

First, install [the Loqate app](https://apps.shopify.com/loqate) from the Shopify
App Store (see
the [Shopify app installation instructions](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/installing-apps) for
more details). Once that is done:

- You should automatically be taken to the Admin section for your new Loqate app

- If not, go to [accounts.shopify.com](https://accounts.shopify.com/), select the
  **Your store** option, then select the **Loqate** app on the left-hand side of
  the screen to open it

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/123ee5c4-loqate-app.png" />
</Frame>

- Copy and paste your Loqate API key in to the*API Key* field on this screen,
  then click the **Save** button:

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/3b52485d-api-key-july-24.png" />
</Frame>

With that done, you can add one or more of the Loqate services to your store
using the steps below.

#### Address Capture

With the app installed, Address Capture is automaticallyavailable. There is,
however, an additional step to make sure Address Capture is added to your
checkout. Here are the steps to follow:

- In the Admin section of your Shopify Plus account, go to
  **`Settings > Checkout`**. From here you can either edit your existing
  checkout, or create a new draft of your checkout layout
- To edit your existing checkout clickthe **Customize** button, or to create a
  new draft checkout clickthe **Duplicate** button followed by **Customize** on
  the new version

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/9d6c0459-duplicate-checkout.png" />
</Frame>

- Once you're editing your checkout, go to the Settings menu (the cog icon on
  the left-hand side), scroll down to the **Address autocompletion** section and
  select the **Loqate** option to set Loqate as your provider:

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/638b545b-address-autocompletion.png" />
</Frame>

- Make sure you save the changes to your checkout, then exit the editor. If you
  created a new checkout draft, you can clickthe **Publish** button to make it
  live

Address Capture will now be available on your checkout. If you also want to
enable Address Verify and/or Email Validation, carry on through the next
sections.

#### Address Verify

There are a few steps required toenableAddress Verify functionalityto your
checkout:

First,you need to addthe **Loqate-Checkout** app block to your store
(see [https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/blog/customize-shopify-checkout](https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/blog/customize-shopify-checkout)).
App blocks allow you to customise the look and functionality of your checkout
layout and process, and this block is required in order to use Address Verify on
the Thank You page. Here's how to add this block:

- In the Admin section of your Shopify Plus account, go to`Settings > Checkout`.
  From here you can either edit your existing checkout, or create a new draft of
  your checkout layout (see the Address Capture section above for more details)
- Next, select the Apps icon (the bottom icon) in the left-hand menu of the
  checkout editor, then search for 'Loqate'
- select the **loqate-checkout** app, then click the plus button and select **Thank
  you** from the drop-down list - this adds the app block to the Thank You page

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/471008df-add-app-block.png" />
</Frame>

- With that done, make sure you save the changes to your checkout, then exit the
  editor. If you created a new checkout draft, you can clickthe **Publish**
  button to make it live.

The next step is to disable the default address verification by Shopify. If this
is left enabled, additional suggestions may be displayed against individual
address fields, which can cause confusion for customers.

- Still in Settings > Checkout, scroll down to the **Address collection
  preferences** section:

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/887da748-address-collection-small.png" />
</Frame>

- Make sure the **Validate shipping address** option is unticked, then click the
  **Save&#x20;**&#x62;utton

The final step is to enable Address Verify in the Loqate app's Admin page.

**NOTE:&#x20;**&#x41;ddress Verify is only available if you're using a Classic
platform API key. If you're using a Saas platform API key, the Address Verify
section below the API key section will remain greyed out.

If you're using a Classic platform API key, once you've entered your key into
the API Key field in the Loqate app's Admin page, the Address Verify section
below will become editable:

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/66eb0c08-verify-1-december-2024.png" />
</Frame>

- Scroll down to the Address Verify section and select the **Enable address
  verification for post checkout** option
  - NOTE: to use the post checkout option, please ensure your store is not
    [password protected](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/password-page)
- If you alsowant to enable Address Verify on the checkout page you canselect the
  **Enable address verificationfor checkout** option too - this is not
  recommended, however, andthis option will be removed soon
- Clickthe **Save** button, and Address Verify will now be available.

#### Email Validation

The steps to enable Email Validation in your checkout are similar to those for
Address Verify.

First, addthe **Loqate-Checkout** app block to your store - but this time it
needs to be added tothe **Checkout** section.

- In the Admin section of your Shopify Plus account, go to`Settings > Checkout`.
  From here you can either edit your existing checkout, or create a new draft of
  your checkout layout (see the Address Capture section above for more details)
- Select the Apps icon (the bottom icon) in the left-hand menu of the checkout
  editor, then search for 'Loqate'
- select the **loqate-checkout** app, then click the plus button and
  select **Checkout** from the drop-down list

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/3e928b36-add-app-block-2.png" />
</Frame>

Once that's done, you just need to select the **Enable email validation**option
from the 'Email Validation' section onthe Loqate app's Admin page:

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/eaf21826-email-validation-december-2024.png" />
</Frame>

Once that's selected, click the **Save&#x20;**&#x62;utton and move on to the
next section.

### Recommended: include company name

By default, Shopify is set to not include a**Company name**address field. As
such, if an address includes a company name (for example if a customer orders a
delivery to their place of work) it won't be included in the address that's
populated in Shopify.

We recommend setting Shopify to include Company name as an optional address
field, so that it will be populated any time an address does include a company
name. Here's how to change that setting:

- Go to the site Settings page for your Shopify store
- select the **Checkout&#xA0;**&#x6F;ption from the left-hand menu
- Scroll down tothe **Customer information** section

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/941fe3e7-company-name-settings.png" />
</Frame>

- Set Company name to **Optional**, then click the*Save*button

With that done, you should now see an optional Company address field in the
checkout:

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/ae39df81-company-name-1.png" />
</Frame>

###

We recommend always using Address Capture, as this helps reduce the chances of
mistakes caused by manual address entry, ensuring addresses can be trusted as
correct and giving the best customer experience. It is, however, possible to use
just Address Verification or just Email Validation if you don't want any kind of
address autocompletion functionality.

If you want to use Address Verification and/or Email Validation on their own,
follow the full installation and setup process as above, then you can manually
disable Address Capture. Here's how to do that:

- First, make sure that you've enabled at least one of Address Verification
  and/or Email Validation (see the '[Basic Setup](#Basic)' section earlier)
- Then, go to Settings > checkout and clickthe **Customize&#xA0;**&#x6F;ption
  for your checkout
- Click onthe **Settings&#xA0;**&#x69;con on the left-hand side, then scroll
  down to the **Address autocompletion** section

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/15716112-address-autocompletion.png" />
</Frame>

- Untickthe **Use address autocompletion&#xA0;**&#x6F;ption, then save the
  change to your Checkout configuration

This will have disabled the Address Capture functionality, while leaving Address
Verify and/or Email Validation running.

### Optional: Advanced Settings

The Advanced Settings page is located inthe Admin section of your Loqate app,
and includes the following optionalsettings.

#### Display a custom Loqate capture address search input on the checkout page

Selecting this option adds an additional 'Search for address' field onto the
checkout page, which allows for containers to be used in searching for
addresses. Entering a street, road or apartment building will where appropriate
return a container displaying the number of addresses:

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/4ef73e52-containers-1.png" />
</Frame>

Select an option from the list to see a list of addresses within the container:

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/b3dcf16e-containers-2.png" />
</Frame>

Note that with this enabled, Verify will not fire on the Thank You page when
customers select addresses returned by Address Capture, unless they subsequently
edit a returned address.

#### Force addresses to be returned in latin character sets where available

With this selected, Address Capture will always attempt to use any English
results to set the delivery address, even with non-latin results. Note that for
this setting to work, the 'Display a custom Loqate capture address search input
on the checkout page' option must be **enabled**.

For example, here's a Japanese address searched for using Kanji characters:

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/d4f302db-non-latin-1.png" />
</Frame>

And here's the result populated using the English version of the address:

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/05e9fb77-non-latin-2.png" />
</Frame>

This is useful for when carriers have difficulty processing non-latin addresses.

## In use

Once the Loqate Shopify app is installed and configured, your customers can
start using Loqate's Address Capture service when inputting their addresses.
Here's an overview of what this looks like in practice, using an example
checkout page:

We've also put together some screenshots of how that might look on an example
checkout page, to give you a sense of what to expect.

##### Address Capture

Here's what it looks like during an address lookup and after an address has been
selected in the Delivery address section:

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/2b708d6c-checkout-1-july-2024.png" />
</Frame>

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/5438b97b-checkout-2-july-2024.png" />
</Frame>

And here's what it looks like during an address lookup and after an address has
been selected in the Billing address section:

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/e2cb4a48-billing-1-july-2024.png" />
</Frame>

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/e910b0d3-billing-2-july-2024.png" />
</Frame>

Note: the countries listed inthe **Country/Region** dropdown list are tied
directly to what you've set in the 'Shipping and delivery' section of your
Shopify store settings. Therefore, if you only ship to certain countries, only
those countries will appear in the dropdown. If a customer enters an address
outside of those countries, Address Capture will not be able to return
suggestions in the country they're looking for and Address Verify will not
recognise the inputted address (see the Address Verify section below).

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/9eaf86d1-country-dropdown-1.png" />
</Frame>

##### Address Verify

If you have enabled Address Verify, this functionality will trigger on the Thank
You page after a customer has confirmed an order.

Immediately after the Thank You page loads, a message will appear saying "Please
wait while we verify your address...":

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/c95bb389-verify-thankyou-0.png" />
</Frame>

This message will adjust depending on the results that Address Verify can
return, with three main possibilities:

- No changes required
- Alternative address found
- Address not validated

**No changes required**

If the customer's address is successfully verified with no changes required, the
Address Verify message will change to "Your shipping address has been
verified!":

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/2423f31f-verify-thankyou-01.png" />
</Frame>

**Alternative address found**

If, however, Address Verify finds an alternative address to suggest, the message
will instead change to say "We've found an alternate address", and give the
customer the option of either applying or declining the proposed changes:

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/0dbb16b7-verify-thankyou-1.png" />
</Frame>

If the customer clicks**Apply changes**, the message will change to say "Your
shipping address has been updated":

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/ee4c0b63-verify-thankyou-2.png" />
</Frame>

**NOTE:** customers will not see the updated address reflected on the Thank You
page, however if you check the Orders section of your Shopify Plus account and
find the transaction in question, you'll see that the shipping address has been
updated.

For example, here you can see that the billing address remains as it was
originally inputted, but the shipping address has been corrected by Address
Verify:

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/5698645d-verify-thankyou-4.png" />
</Frame>

You can also see evidence of the update in the order's timeline:

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/f65ada20-verify-thankyou-3.png" />
</Frame>

Not all customers will choose to use the alternative addresses offered by
Address Verify, however. If a customer chooses to ignore the suggestion, they
will instead see a message which says "Your shipping address was not updated":

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/4c561bf1-verify-thankyou-5.png" />
</Frame>

**Address not validated**

Lastly, if an address is sufficiently low quality that Address Verify can't
validate it, the customer will instead see a message reading "Your shipping
address could not be validated, your order will still be processed."

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/368fed0f-verify-thankyou-6.png" />
</Frame>

##### Email Validation

If you have enabled Email Validation, this functionality will trigger when a
customer enters an invalid email address. Here's what that will look like:

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/2b8e280b-email-validation-usage-august-2024.png" />
</Frame>

When a customer enters a valid email address, this notification will disappear
and they will be able to proceed through the checkout.

## Troubleshooting

#####

##### I can't see some of the Admin options described in this guide

The Loqate Shopify Integration requires a Shopify Plus account. If you don't use
Shopify Plus, you won't see all of the necessary options and won't be able to
use this integration.

##### The Capture autocomplete field is not showing on my checkout

Ensure that the API key is correct on the Admin page.

##### When selecting an address, the fields do not populate

Ensure that your API key is correct on the Admin page, and that you have
sufficient credit on your Loqate account.

##### How do I uninstall the Loqate app?**&#x20;**

If you no longer want to use the Loqate Shopify Plus integration, you can
uninstall it from your Shopify Plus store.

**Please note:** if you uninstall the Loqate app and then want to start using it
again at a later date, you will need to go through the full installation process
again.

To uninstall the Loqate app, go to the Admin page of the app within your Shopify
account and click on the three dots at the top-right of the screen. You will see
an option to uninstall there:

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/b553fa4e-uninstall.png" />
</Frame>

When you click **Uninstall**, you'll be prompted to choose a reason for
uninstalling:

<Frame caption="">
  <img src="/images/383b1f7e-uninstall-2.png" />
</Frame>

Select one or more reasons, then click the **Uninstall** button. This will
uninstall the app and return you to the 'Installed Apps' section of your Admin
page.
