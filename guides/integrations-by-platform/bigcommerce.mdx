Before you start, make sure you have a Loqate account. If you don’t already have
one, you will need to [sign up](https://account.loqate.com/Register/).

### Set up

In order to set up Loqate for BigCommerce, please follow these steps:

In your [Loqate account](https://account.loqate.com/Login/) select "Add service

“BigCommerce” from the suggested options below, and hit "Next".

You will be presented with a code snippet. Copy this, as you'll need to use it
later.

Click the "Generate my mappings" button at the bottom of the page. This will
generate mappings that match the standard BigCommerce field layout.

Next, log in to BigCommerce and go to"Script Manager". You can access this by
clicking Sidebar > Storefront > Script Manager.

Once in this section you want to add Script Library, then fill out the
checkboxes as follows:
