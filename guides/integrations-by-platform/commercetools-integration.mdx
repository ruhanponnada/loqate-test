The Loqate commercetools plugin (`loqate-commercetools-b2c-frontend`) provides
integration between [the commercetools platform](https://commercetools.com/) and
the Loqate API.

### Overview

The [loqate-commercetools](https://github.com/loqate/loqate-commercetools)
repository contains a commercetools plugin that integrates with the Loqate API
to provide access to Address Capture, Address Verify, Email Validation, and
Phone Validation.

The plugin makes modifications in the following areas:

- Checkout
- My Account
- Registration

The modifications are applied in two areas:

- **Backend-for-frontend (BFF):** commercetools extensions - used to make the
  Loqate API calls and handle the responses
- **Frontend:** React components - used to display the address capture, address
  verification, email validation, and phone validation features

### Feature overview

The following Loqate products are supported:

- **[Address Capture](/guides/commercetool-integration/feature-overview/#address-capture "Commercetools Integration: Feature Overview"):**
  suggests addresses based on user input
- **[Address Verify](/guides/commercetool-integration/feature-overview/#address-verify "Commercetools Integration: Feature Overview"):**
  verifies address validity
- **[Email Validation](/guides/commercetool-integration/feature-overview/#email-validation "Commercetools Integration: Feature Overview"):**
  validates email addresses
- **[Phone Validation](/guides/commercetool-integration/feature-overview/#phone-validation "Commercetools Integration: Feature Overview"):**

These features can be toggled on or off through project settings.

### Disclaimers

The loqate-commercetools repository demonstrates the integration of Loqate
Address Capture, Address Verify, Email Validation and Phone Validation features
with commercetools. It is to be used as a reference implementation for your own
integration - it is not intended to be used as is in a production environment.
Please refer to the
[Setup Guide](/guides/commercetool-integration/setup-guide "Commercetools Integration: Setup Guide")
for instructions on the changes required to carry over the Loqate commercetools
integration into your own project.

It uses the
[commercetools Frontend B2C template](https://docs.commercetools.com/frontend-development/b2c-store-launchpad-overview)
as a base, specifically the latest as of 3 June 2024.

This plugin:

- Does not aim to keep up with the latest changes in the commercetools frontend
  template, but rather to provide a reference implementation
- Should not be cloned and used as is in a production environment. It is
  recommended to use it as a reference and adapt it to your own needs by copying
  the relevant parts of the code and applying them to the merchant's
  implementation
- Does not aim to fix any bugs or issues in the commercetools frontend template.
  If you encounter any issues related with the B2C Frontend Template, please
  refer to the [commercetools documentation](https://docs.commercetools.com/)
- Is not responsible for any bugs or issues coming from the commercetools B2C
  Frontend Template, nor any customizations made to it and does not aim to fix
  them. You should refer to the commercetools documentation for support for any
  issues related to the specific version of the commercetools B2C Frontend
  Template that you are using
- Does not take an opinion of the flow you should support in your store - it
  applies changes to the out of the box checkout, my account and registration
  flows
