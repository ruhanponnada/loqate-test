## What is SERP

The Address Accuracy Software Evaluation and Recognition Program (SERP) ensures the best postage rates for your mailing list.

### Platform Availability

SERP is currently only available on the following platforms:

- Windows 32
- Windows 64
- Linux 64
- AIX 64

### Release Cycle

Please note, SERP dataset expiration dates are set by the postal authority. Please ensure that you have the latest library and data installed to avoid loss of service through these products.

### How To Run SERP

There are two ways to run the SERP certified certification in the Loqate Engine:

1. You may invoke the SERP certification process for Canada directly by adding the process “SERP” to the process-list.

In batch mode, run **lqtbatch** with the process set as “serp”.

lqtbatch will also generate a SERP address accuracy report, if you specify the option “-r SERP” as follows:

- lqtbatch … -p serp -r SERP

2. You may invoke the certification process by calling the “verify” process while setting the server-option “CertifiedCountryList” to “CAN” – this will internally invoke the SERP process for Canadian addresses in your dataset. As we extend our certification process support to other countries, you will be able to specify the countries for which you want to run the certified process (as opposed to the Loqate “verify” process) through comma-separated list of country code values for the “CertifiedCountryList” option.

### Input Requirement

**Important note:**SERP process requires the input addresses to be in thefollowing format as input. The input headers must also match Loqate address fields, found on the support site [here](/field-descriptions/addfields/).

- Address1 (required)
